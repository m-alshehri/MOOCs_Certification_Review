Unlike traditional courses, MOOCs require additional skills, provided by videographers, instructional designers, IT specialists and platform specialists. Over the past few years several Universities facilitated partnership with MOOCs providers and are building MOOC courses, to serve as e-learning versions of their courses. Despite all the advantages offered by the MOOC courses, the current statistics show that only a very limited number of registered learners are completing the course. And the vast majority are stopping learning at an early stage. The main reason can be found in the lack of motivation of the students to pass the exams to become a certificate, because universities do not accept the certificates for credits. The aim of this paper is to study the readiness of students to take MOOC courses on one hand and the acceptance of MOOC courses in Universities. A study is conducted on two Universities, Hasselt University, Belgium and Princess Sumaya University for Technology, Jordan. The results of the study are promising, as they suggest that such virtual study programs are accepted in both Universities.

We often hear about the high dropout rates in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). On the other hand, there is a lot of movement towards micro-credentials, online master's degrees based on MOOCs, and formal MOOC degrees. However, what is the classic MOOC clientele actually doing with their certificates? What are the reasons why successful MOOC learners put a lot of time and effort in exams and exercises? Do employers accept these certificates in application portfolios? Do they allow their employees to participate in a MOOC during their working hours? Do they pay for the certificates? Are there any differences concerning gender because women are still in the minority in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) and their career paths often hit a plateau? These questions have been on our mind since we started offering courses on our MOOC platform in 2012. We have had anecdotal evidence, for example, that a participant was helped to get a new job with a certificate from one of our courses-yet this is ultimately just hearsay.

Industry leaders can benefit from these courses because they foster the professional development of their employees in their industry. Despite these benefits, these online courses continue to register a high dropout rate and a vast number of their learners do not acquire the certificate provided at the completion of the course. This article proposes a predictive modeling tool with several Machine Learning algorithms (for generating Predictive Models) and feature engineering in MOOCs data integrated to contribute research to this specific issue. The proposed tool predicts two situations: which learners are likely to leave the course (dropout) and which learners are expected to pass the course (certificate acquisition). The tool was tested in fifteen deliveries of seven MOOCs. Initial results provide interesting information, for instance, that the accuracy of predicting certificate acquisition is higher than the precision of predicting dropout for all algorithms.",2157-362X,978-1-5386-6786-6,10.1109/IEEM.2018.8607541,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8607541,Educational Data Mining;learning Analytics;lifelong Learning;machine Learning;MOOC;professional Learning,Tools;Predictive models;Prediction algorithms;Input variables;Graphics;Data mining;Machine learning algorithms,certification;computer aided instruction;continuing professional development;distance learning;educational courses;learning (artificial intelligence);personnel,professional development;MOOCs data;certificate acquisition;lifelong learning;dropout rate;machine learning algorithms;learning analytics tool;professional learning;massive open online courses;dropout predictive modeling tool,,1,,14,,13-Jan-19,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

The grades students receive on these tests and assignments determine whether they complete or become certified in course material. However, beyond receiving a certification, how do grades impact the learning behavior in students? Do students who receive poor grades actively change their overall activity to improve their grades? To better understand the impact of grades, we observe overall student activity on two MITx MOOCs for certified students and students who continuously participate in MOOC assignments. We use click stream data to compile the overall activity of a student and we use points earned divided by total possible points to calculate the students' grades. We observe that students with the highest levels of activity have some of the highest grades. We also observe that the difference in activity before and after the finalization of a grade (delta-activity) have greater variation as grade increases. Finally, we observe very little changes in grades (delta-grade) for certified students when visualized against delta-activity and that continuously participating students have greater grade changes compared to certified students.",,978-1-7281-2549-7,10.1109/LWMOOCS47620.2019.8939614,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8939614,MOOCs;data analysis;grades;student behavior;feedback,Computer aided instruction;Electronic learning;Correlation;Certification,computer aided instruction;educational courses;Internet,learning behavior;massive open online courses;course material;certified students;MOOC assignments;continuously participating students;student grade;continued participation;certification,,,,7,,27-Dec-19,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

The current higher education system cannot satisfy this need in many fields, e.g. Gartner predicts, that already in 2015 only a third of jobs for big data analysts can be filled [2]. The rapid development of Information and Communication Technology (ITC, IT) has changed many aspects of teaching and learning. Educational materials are moving into cloud(s) and degrees are given on-line (`Master's Degree Online Directory' lists over 90,000 programs [3]), old-fashioned Colleges and Universities with large campus, staff and high costs are getting more and more competition from numerous educational entrepreneurs, who start massive open online courses (MOOC) with millions of users/students from all around the world; they establish new on-line universities where costs of obtaining a degree are marginal compared to `brick-and-mortal' universities and which are open to nearly everyone independent of user geographical location. Until now MOOC have not yet proved their value-less than 4% of enrollees complete the courses [4] and they do not receive (yet) university diploma. But the World most prestigious technical university, MIT, has already set up a certification system - students who can master the subjects taught in MOOC receive an official certificate of completion [5]. Although these certificates will not carry the weight of a traditional MIT diploma (they will be issued by started by MIT online learning initiative called MITx), but the word `MIT' alone carries a weight. When speaking about possibilities of IT in education most speakers/writers are excitedly discussing technology-servers, communication lines, bandwidth, security (preferably all in thick cloud of technical jargon). Nearly nobody presents practical experience, suggestions and/or theories about how to teach with this new technology in order best to utilize its possibilities. The `education in the cloud' mainly consists of video clips trying to repeat the classroom experience: recorded before the old-fashioned blackboard (only nowadays it is white), where professor is presenting the same lecture what he presented in lecture hall, only now lectures are cut into 5-10 min video clips - the `mobile approach'. Is this why the old lecture halls are still needed? Rapidly increasing costs of University Education, increasing competition of educational entrepreneurs and constant increase of population of working students have made clear, that both sides of University education - teaching/learning and accrediting, giving diplomas need changes. University Education should more take into account students informal and non-formal learning, their participation in professional work - both in organization of study and in certification.

A service science context in education driven by disruptive innovation and the Internet of Things,S. Farrell; A. Rucinski,"IFEES & ASEE & Rowan University, USA; ISSIP & University of New Hampshire. USA",2013 International Conference on Interactive Collaborative Learning (ICL),24-Oct-13,2013,,,377,378,"Summary form only given. Global Engineering is the last frontier in education. It creates a dilemma of providing engineering education anywhere in the World, preserving local cultural values, and applying it anywhere around the Globe. A recent Singapore Declaration [ASEE Global Forum, 2009], and consecutive World Engineering Education Forums, [1] paved the roadmap towards Global Engineering calling for practical solutions to implement the vision of a global engineer. In response to these challenges, several “disruptive innovation” [Christensen, 1995] solutions such as Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC) and Massive Open Online Laboratories (MOOL) have been introduced including the one based on the Internet of Things (IOT) and disruptive microelectronics [2]. Disruptive Microelectronics which includes embedded systems, Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC), Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA), and Programmable Systems On a Chip (PSOC), is one of excellent case studies of disruptive technologies (or disruptive innovation) which is defined as an innovation that helps create a new market and value network, and eventually goes on to disrupt an existing market and value network (over a few years or decades), displacing an earlier technology. The Internet of Things is the next generation of the Internet connecting objects, not just people. Since the ultimate goal is to produce new industries globally, understanding, measuring, evaluating, and preserving the integrity of global engineering becomes fundamental. The latter is proposed to be addressed by Quality Assessment (QA) of emerging global engineering curricula and scholars involved in teaching of global engineering. For example, International Society for Engineering Education (IGIP) is one of the leaders providing international certification of scholars and one of the frontrunners in fostering engineering on line, critical for global engineering. The overall process of global engineering education addressing essential skills for engineers from any country to be competitive in an international market for engineering knowhow, with skills not longer limited to cultural sensitivity needed only for product design destined for diverse markets can be superbly captured by Service Science [Spohrer, 2008]. Service science is an interdisciplinary paradigm to the study, design, and implementation of complex systems in which specific arrangements of people and technologies take actions that provide value for others [3]. It is also a proposed academic discipline and research area that would complement multiplicity of disciplines that contribute to knowledge about service.",,978-1-4799-0153-1,10.1109/ICL.2013.6644604,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6644604,,Engineering education;Internet;Certification;Technological innovation;Conferences;Educational institutions,computer aided instruction;engineering computing;engineering education;Internet of Things;teaching,service science context;disruptive innovation;Internet of Things;global engineering education;Singapore Declaration;World Engineering Education Forums;massive open online courses;MOOC;massive open online laboratories;MOOL;disruptive microelectronics;embedded systems;application specific integrated circuits;ASIC;field programmable gate arrays;FPGA;programmable systems-on-a-chip;PSOC;disruptive technologies;quality assessment;teaching;International Society for Engineering Education;IGIP;service science;modified T-Shape diagram;online engineering;global engineering solution;disruptive education;Web of Objects;IGIP system;IGIP ING PAED Certification;pedagogical expertise;Indo-US Collaboration for Engineering Education;Kazakhstan-Indo-US Collaboration for Engineering Education;Latin America - The Latin American and Caribbean Consortium of Engineering Institutions;IGIP curriculum,,2,,5,,24-Oct-13,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

These open courses typically offer some form of recognition, such as a certificate of completion and/or digital badge, to recognize, validate, and in some cases even accredit learning. A general problem with MOOCs is the uncertainty regarding the use and goals of recognition, validation, and accreditation (RVA), and participants' acceptance and perception of such techniques. This research effort addresses this problem by exploring course participants' attitudes and levels of acceptance of non-formal learning recognition compared to traditional university credit in both developed and developing countries. The actual study uses both certificates of completion and digital badges to recognize and validate learning in an introductory, university level course in web programming using HTML5/CSS. The course is available to anyone, but was specifically marketed to participants from Sweden and Kenya. Empirical data was gathered using interviews and online surveys in the course.

This attracts a large number of learners, each with their own individual intentions and motivations to join a course. However, personal support and guidance can almost never be provided at this scale. All learners have to follow the same usually weekly structured content and the learning success is only measured by the achievement of a certificate. To overcome this one-size-fits-all approach with technical means, we introduced a tool for Personalized Learning Objectives. This enables learners to achieve more individual objectives in courses, follow different learning paths, and link their motivations and intentions to the definition of learning success. Previous studies have already examined, among other aspects, the usefulness, acceptance, and achievement rates of learning objectives in MOOCs. In this complimentary research, the satisfaction of students with and without a selected learning objective is compared in a course on topics from the field of Design Thinking.",,978-1-7281-9728-9,10.1109/LWMOOCS50143.2020.9234349,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9234349,MOOCs;Learning Objectives;Goal-Oriented Learning;Self-Regulated Learning;E-Learning,,computer aided instruction;educational courses,individual intentions;personal support;weekly structured content;learning success;one-size-fits-all approach;personalized learning objectives;individual objectives;learning paths;MOOC;selected learning objective;Design Thinking;Massive Open Online Courses,,,,13,,26-Oct-20,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

MOOC panel - Future educational challenges in computer engineering education: Will MOOCs be a threat or an opportunity?,,,2014 International Conference on Field-Programmable Technology (FPT),09-Apr-15,2014,,,1,1,"Summary form only given, as follows. The MOOC (massively open online course) is said to be a ""game-changer"" by The New York Times. The major MOOC platforms are the non-profit edX, supported by a consortium of universities led by MIT and Harvard; and the for-profits Coursera, launched by Stanford professors Andrew Ng and Daphne Koller, and Udacity, launched by Sebastian Thrun. These online courses are massive in scale enrolling thousands of students limited only by the technology. They are openly available at zero cost. However, some courses charge a minimum fee for the certification. The course is available online and so can be accessed remotely if there is an internet connection. They help in decentralizing the education system. This creates an internet of education. It also helps to overcome the cultural and social barriers that hindered people from accessing education. MOOCs will allow people to educate themselves based on what they want to learn. It gives them a wide range of topics to choose and learn. They can take advantage of the growing computer awareness and IT penetration. MOOCs are already a big hit in rural communities and developing countries where people don't have as much access to traditional schools and colleges. MOOCs are causing a massive shift in the way people learn and access education. In spite of these advantages, they have their share of disadvantages too. The technology is unreliable. There is a lack of interest among the governments to initiate the institutional change. Also the pace of implementation is a grave concern. People worry that this could lead to a one-way transfer of educational materials from the rich countries to the poor countries will amount to a wave of ""intellectual neo-colonialism."" Also, language is a major barrier to have a global reach. The emphasis shifts from the teacher to the teaching material. Students have to digest the information and learn by themselves. They review the content in isolation and try to learn without access to peers or professors. This makes it difficult to stay motivated. Students are also missing the traditional face-to-face interactions. Lastly, schools and employers do not take MOOCs seriously. Therefore, there is a mixed response from the educators. Some see them as an opportunity and some see them as a threat.",,978-1-4799-6245-7,10.1109/FPT.2014.7082826,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7082826,,Internet;Computer science education;Terminology;Certification;Cultural differences,,,,,,,,09-Apr-15,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

The preliminary results show that additional efforts are needed in order to boost the enrolment of both females and people with low level of completed studies, as well as increasing the level of awareness regarding certification. The results also reveal a positive impact of the course on the participants' professional and personal spheres. Finally, the most relevant interaction for them is the learner-content interaction. On the basis of these results it can be concluded that this MOOC offers an opportunity for practitioners to take advantage of the Open Education philosophy and its subsequent application to their everyday educational environment.",0730-3157,978-1-5386-2667-2,10.1109/COMPSAC.2018.10248,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8377876,"open education, open educational resources, OER, OER repositories, MOOC",Electronic mail;Certification;Europe;Open Educational Resources;Employment;Videos,computer aided instruction;educational courses,MOOC Foundations;educational environment;open education philosophy;IEEE education society;IEEE free online course;OER repositories;MOOC Knowledge data collection;socio-demographic issues;open educational resources repositories;student interaction;awareness regarding certification;participants professional spheres;participants personal spheres;learner-content interaction;participants academic spheres,,,,6,,22-Jun-18,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Several circumstances may cause dropout at any stage of the course and, in any case, before getting the certificate. Some students are not able to follow the course, others fail in the exams and leave, others only aim at getting a general overview of the course contents, others take all the activities but the final test, because of being interested in gaining knowledge but not in obtaining the certificate, etc. For this reason, it is interesting to analyze and understand the behavior of each student while interacting with the course. In this direction, the goal of this work is to predict whether a student will abandon a MOOC before completing it, so that it is possible to intervene accordingly, by warning the teacher about the dropout risk, notifying the student about this risk, etc. Different machine learning techniques have been tested with real data of a MOOC supported by EdX at UAM.

Leveraging Linked Data to Propel Competency-Based Education Based on Labour Skills,S. Nahhas; O. Bamasag; M. Khemakhem; N.

Competency-based education (CBE) is a paradigm that can combine the both benefits. Linked data technology has potentials that help education to be more oriented towards CBE by linking the education with competences fields such as labour. However, that needs the education courses to be updated according to labours' demands which require lifelong learning to make individuals kept up with the emerging competences and technologies. CBE and lifelong learning are related to open education such as OCWs, MOOCs and OERs; since MOOCs for example give the chance to learn from the industry leaders which is very effective for CBE and can be acquired anytime. Also, open education is more responsive to the emerging demands of labour. Based on that, traditional universities have a possibility to update their courses based on the CBE rather than starting from scratch. Therefore, making mutual integration between traditional and open education courses based on labours' competences can offer an opportunity to go towards CBE. In this paper we propose a novel approach to refine education courses to be more oriented towards CBE by this mutuality integration. Input to this approach is the course information and the output is lists of candidate competences concepts that a course designer can use to refine current courses' topics and learning outcomes based on labour skills. Also developing a new metrics is suggested based on conducting some statistics to measure the importance of the concept regarding the CBE and measure how much the whole course is related to the labour needs. Lastly, developing a bridged model based on the competences concepts to be as anchors is suggested to provide links to the related OERs and related courses from MOOCS/OCWs.",,978-1-7281-0108-8,10.1109/CAIS.2019.8769503,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8769503,competency-based education;linked data;open education;MOOC;OCW;OER,Linked data;Data models;Education courses;Ontologies;Knowledge based systems;Industries,computer aided instruction;educational courses;educational institutions,labour skills;CBE;competency-based education;linked data technology;lifelong learning;open education course;certificates;OCW;MOOC;OER;universities,,,,12,,25-Jul-19,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Through web platforms, universities and other institutions offer content and courses where any student can enroll. With this new approach, much knowledge that previously was only accessible to official students paying, in general, expensive fees, is now accessible to any citizen for free. In addition, institutions of higher education usually grant a certificate to students who passed the course. However, this divulgative and massive open approach also creates some distortions. In particular, the management of MOOC courses is a task of extreme complexity, due to the mixture of a large number of very different student profiles, and the combination of nonaligned interests. As a consequence, the dropout rate in these courses is higher than 70% in most courses. In any case, before proposing any solution, it is necessary to analyze and study the current situation in a systematic and scientific way. Therefore, this article describes an experience carried out jointly by professors from the Universidad Politécnica de Madrid (UPM, Spain) and the University of Tras os Montes e Alto Douro (Portugal), based on the creation and teaching of a MOOC course focused on domotics and Arduino technologies, accessible on the MiriadaX platform.

This MOOC Técnico course related to electromagnetism differs from the remaining courses because it includes a strong laboratorial component which challenges students to understand and analyse experimental data collected during the course. With the present analysis, we intended to study the participants' background, understand what they aim to achieve by enrolling the course and how the nature of its contents and activities affects their overall success. In more detail, we determined how the inclusion of activities such as hands-on experiments, operation of remote laboratories and open questions with peer review evaluations affect the dropout rates and the evaluations obtained by the students. This information is crucial to tailor the course to the student's needs, ultimately improving the course quality and the student's learning experience. To achieve this, data regarding the students characteristics and the number of active participants for the different course stages was collected. The results showed a large participation of people from outside the Técnico Lisboa (IST) community (enrolled students, teachers, researchers, staff, alumni) and a high variety of academic paths inside it. These also made clear that a considerable amount of the enrolled participants dropped out of the course as soon as the proposed tasks became more demanding.

The emotional orientations are typically related with specific learning topics or aspects discussed, which is of value to offer abundant academic feedbacks for teachers and developers. Especially, the negative emotion and topics can be exploited to get an in-depth insight of the problems and barriers encountered by learners in online learning. However, it is challenging to capture relevant details from unstructured SGCs. In this paper, we propose a generative probabilistic model that extends Sentence-LDA (SLDA), namely Emotion Topic Joint Probabilistic Model (ETJM), to explore negative opinions in terms of pairs of which we call emo-topic. The model first automatically extracts the sentences with the high negative emotion density (NED), and then incorporates emotion and topic together to explore negative emotional feedbacks towards topics. The experimental results show that learners extended some negative comments towards the issues about learning content, online assignments and certificates of courses. The summarization of these issues can be given back to teachers to regulate and improve the teaching methods, strategies and design of learning contents.",,978-1-5386-0629-2,10.1109/EITT.2017.29,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8308514,Negative Topics;Emotion Topic Joint Probabilistic Model (ETJM);student-generated comments (SGCs);sentiment analysis,Probabilistic logic;Analytical models;Education;Market research;Semantics;Correlation;Big Data,computer aided instruction;educational courses;human factors;interactive systems;Internet;probability;psychology;teaching,negative academic emotion;interactive learning technologies;primary emotions;emotional orientations;specific learning topics;online learning;unstructured SGCs;generative probabilistic model;Emotion Topic Joint Probabilistic Model;negative opinions;high negative emotion density;negative emotional feedbacks;negative comments;online assignments;learning contents;academic feedbacks;student-generated online course comments,,1,,14,,12-Mar-18,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

The professor of electrical engineering and computer science said so himself as he welcomed his vast horde of online students. And it was a horde: More than 150 000 of us from dozens of countries had signed up for MIT’s inaugural MOOC, or massively open online course, which began in early March and ended in June. The course, dubbed 6.002x, was an adaptation of MIT’s undergraduate class in circuit design and analysis and was part of the university’s MITx initiative, which aims to offer anyone with an Internet connection access to a selection of its courses. Participants were lured by some powerful enticements: MIT’s prestige, the opportunity to learn from a renowned professor, and the price-free. Although MIT has made course materials publicly available for over a decade, this is its first online class involving scheduled instruction, supervision, and testing. Only participants who formally signed up for the 6.002x course were eligible to earn a credential certifying successful completion; MIT has not announced when the course will be offered again.
