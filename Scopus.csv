The Algae Foundation created the Algae Technology Educational Consortium (ATEC) with five major foci including community college certificate program in algae cultivation; community college curriculum adopted for algal biotechnology degree programs; Algal Massive Open Online Courses (Algal MOOCs); Algae Academy, a kindergarten to 12th grade STEM curriculum initiative; and aquaculture extension education through the Algae Cultivation Extension Short courses (ACES). The results include the education and training of over 102,000 students, aquaculturists, entrepreneurs, and bioeconomy-based professionals aged 8–75 years in all 50 U.S. states and 66 countries. ATEC has completed agreements with 21 community colleges and universities located in Arizona, California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Louisiana, Maine, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, Texas, and Washington. The first ATEC-sponsored certificate degree program graduation was in May 2018. The Algae MOOC #1 has had over 15,752 students enrolled. ATEC initiated the Algae Academy in spring 2016 in Carlsbad, CA, and expanded to serving over 34,000 students in 46 states during the academic year 2019–2020. ACES has enrolled over 1,550 students from 66 countries. © 2021 The Authors.

The Algae Foundation's vision is a future that embraces algae as an essential solution for a sustainable and healthy planet, with a mission to create that future through education, mentoring, and public outreach and engagement. The Algae Foundation intends to promote the power of algae to transform human society and the environment upon which it depends and to facilitate a future in which algae are a fundamental source of energy, nutrition, bioproducts, and ecological services for sustainable societies globally. It is through this vision and mission that the Algae Foundation® created their flagship program, ATEC, in 2015 as a result of a 4‐year, $2.1 million grant, and a subsequent renewal of 3‐year, $1.6 million award from the U.S. Department of Energy's Bioenergy Technologies Office (Levine, 2017 ). This program educates and trains the next generation of employees and entrepreneurs in various aspects of algae technology to support the emerging bioeconomy. ATEC's 75 members are based at universities, colleges, community colleges, national laboratories, consulting companies, algae corporations, public and private schools, and retired professionals, collectively representing more than 750 years of algal‐based education, research, and commercial experience. The work of the Algae Foundation and ATEC includes: (a) recruitment of partner schools; (b) curricula development and course offerings in two separate programs: Algae Cultivation and Algae Biotechnology; (c) production and marketing of a series of Algal Massive Open Online Courses (Algal MOOCs); (d) Algae Academy, a K‐12 algal‐based STEM educational program; (e) Aquaculture Extension Program, Algae Cultivation Extension Short courses (ACES); and (f) identifying and supporting the development of future algal‐based leaders through scholarships, grants, and internships.","Funding for this project was provided by the U.S. Department of Energy's Bioenergy Technologies Office and managed through the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.

We developed a massive open online course (MOOC), The Science of Safety in Healthcare, to present the foundational patient safety principles to a broad global audience of health professionals, learners, and patients interested in patient safety. Objectives: To describe the Science of Safety in Healthcare MOOC, its effects on patient safety competence, and the satisfaction of course participants. Methods: The five-week video-based course was delivered in 2013 and 2014, and was organized in five modules: 1) overview of science of safety and safety culture, 2) enabling and contextual factors that influence patient safety and quality, 3) methods to improve safety and quality, 4) translating evidence intro practice and leading change, and 5) summary and opportunities for capacity building. Each module had three or four segments. Participants were introduced to key concepts, and tools and skills to promote patient safety. Participants completed the Health Professional Education in Patient Safety Survey (H-PEPSS), which measures patient safety competence, and a course satisfaction survey. Pre- and post- course H-PEPSS scores were compared using paired t-tests. Course satisfaction surveys were administered at the completion of the course and six months later. Results: A total of 20,957, and 9679 participants enrolled in the course in 2013 and 2014, respectively. About half of participants were 25–44 years old (57%), and female (54%). Participants joined from over 100 countries. The majority were health professionals (61%) or health professionals in training (7%). Mean H-PEPSS scores improved after course completion, with significant increases on all survey domains in both years (p < 0.01). Mean score differences were: Teamwork 0.68 (95% CI: 0.64, 0.71), Communication 0.70 (95% CI: 0.66, 0.73), Managing Risk 0.79 (95% CI: 0.76, 0.82), Human Environment 0.64 (95% CI: 0.61, 0.68), Recognizing and Responding 0.64 (95% CI: 0.61, 0.68), and Culture 0.72 (95% CI: 0.68, 0.75). About 8% of participants in each cohort earned a certificate of completion. At 6-months post-course, the majority of the participants agreed or agreed strongly that the course content was useful (93%) and that the course positively influenced their clinical practice (69%) and communication (84%). Conclusions: The MOOC course allowed educators to reach a large, diverse audience. The course was well-received and participants reported a significant increase in patient safety competence. As with most MOOCs, rates of completion were low. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Massive open online course; Online learning; Patient safety education","adult; article; capacity building; clinical practice; cohort analysis; course content; drug safety; e-learning; female; health practitioner; human; language; major clinical study; male; patient safety; prospective study; safety culture; satisfaction; skill; teamwork; videorecording; curriculum; education; patient safety; program evaluation; prospective study; Adult; Curriculum; Education, Distance; Female; Humans; Patient Safety; Program Evaluation; Prospective Studies",,,,,"National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, NCATS","The Helene Fuld Health Trust and National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, supported the time and effort of the first author, NIH did not inform or influence the manuscript concept, development, or writing.",,,,,,"Aboumatar, H.J., Development and evaluation of a 3-day patient safety curriculum to advance knowledge, self-efficacy and system thinking among medical students (2012) BMJ Qual.

Especially the dynamic nature of cognitive processing is still a significant research gap. In this study, we proposed an unsupervised topic model named Temporal Cognitive Topic Model (TCTM) to automatically classify cognitive processes and obtain the conditional probability with topics over time. The results indicated that completers had more active and timely cognitive engagement as time went on and tended to use certain cognitive words to discuss the topics related to the examination and certificates, which showed that they had explicit learning goals and plans. Non-completers often used exclusive cognitive words to discuss some off-task content that pointed out a distractive learning process.

They offer low-cost education for both students and content providers; however, currently there is a very low level of course purchasing (less than 1% of the total number of enrolled students on a given online course opt to purchase its certificate). The most recent literature on MOOCs focuses on identifying factors that contribute to student success, completion level and engagement. One of the MOOC platforms’ ultimate targets is to become self-sustaining, enabling partners to create revenues and offset operating costs. Nevertheless, analysing learners’ purchasing behaviour on MOOCs remains limited. Thus, this study aims to predict students purchasing behaviour and therefore a MOOCs revenue, based on the rich array of activity clickstream and demographic data from learners. Specifically, we compare how several machine learning algorithms, namely RandomForest, GradientBoosting, AdaBoost and XGBoost can predict course purchasability using a large-scale data collection of 23 runs spread over 5 courses delivered by The University of Warwick between 2013 and 2017 via FutureLearn. We further identify the common representative predictive attributes that influence a learner’s certificate purchasing decisions. Our proposed model achieved promising accuracies, between 0.82 and 0.91, using only the time spent on each step. We further reached higher accuracy of 0.83 to 0.95, adding learner demographics (e.g. gender, age group, level of education, and country) which showed a considerable impact on the model’s performance. The outcomes of this study are expected to help design future courses and predict the profitability of future runs; it may also help determine what personalisation features could be provided to increase MOOC revenue. © 2021, The Author(s).","Learner analytics; Machine learning; MOOCs; Purchasing prediction","Adaptive boosting; Costs; Curricula; E-learning; Education computing; Forecasting; Machine learning; Operating costs; Population statistics; Profitability; Sales; Common representatives; Content providers; Demographic data; Large scale data; Level of educations; Massive open online course; Purchasing decisions; University of Warwick; Students",,,,,"University of Warwick","The authors wish to thank The University of Warwick for providing access to their FutureLearn courses.",,,,,,"Alamri, A., Predicting MOOCs dropout using only two easily obtainable features from the first week’s activities (2019) International Conference on Intelligent Tutoring Systems, , Springer; Alshehri, M., On the need for fine-grained analysis of Gender versus Commenting Behaviour in MOOCs (2018) Proceedings of the 2018 the 3Rd International Conference on Information and Education Innovations, , ACM; Atenas, J., Model for democratisation of the contents hosted in MOOCs (2015) International Journal of Educational Technology in Higher Education, 12 (1), pp. 3-14; Bello-Orgaz, G., Jung, J.J., Camacho, D., Social big data: Recent achievements and new challenges (2016) Information Fusion, 28, pp. 45-59; Breiman, L., Random forests (2001) Machine Learning, 45 (1), pp. 5-32; Breslow, L., Studying learning in the worldwide classroom research into edX's first MOOC (2013) Research & Practice in Assessment, 8, pp. 13-25; Castaño-Muñoz, J., Kreijns, K., Kalz, M., Punie, Y., Does digital competence and occupational setting influence MOOC participation?

There are three ways for students to earn their credits, namely take the subject course in face-to-face based class, virtual based class or under Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). MOOCs is a model that is developed to help people to learn about certain skills through the online platform, without any limitation in the audience. MOOCs aim to enhance broad collaboration between individuals in creating learning environments that have high scalability and can be accessed by anyone and anywhere. The complexity arises when students undertake a subject course through MOOCs, how to certify the completion of their program in which the certification can be gained easily, and the last how secure the obtained certificate? Blockchain technology can help to improve the quality of MOOCs by providing control of academic records as evidence that someone has completed a learning process on MOOCs. Academic records generated will be stored in one place forever and safely stored in the Blockchain environment. This article will explore how the possible to implement the Blockchain framework in MOOCs to support a freedom of learning in Indonesia. © 2021 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Blockchain; Computer aided instruction; Distance education; Face to face; High scalabilities; Indonesia; Learning environments; Learning process; Learning programs; Massive open online course; Online platforms; Graph theory",,,,,,"Herewith, I deeply acknowledge to CGANT-RG, the University of Jember Indonesia, for the support of this research activity for the year 2021.",,,,,,"Agustin, I H, Prihandini, R M, Dafik, P2 H-super antimagic total labeling of comb product of graphs (2019) AKCE International Journal of Graphs and Combinatorics, 16, pp. 163-171; Gallian, J A, A dynamic Survey of Graph Labeling (2019) The Electronic Journal of Combinatorics, pp. 1-553; Junaidi, A, (2020) The Guideline of Curriculum Reconstruction of Higher Education in the Era of industry 4.0 to Support the Program of Freedom of Learning and the Freedom University untuk mendukung merdeka belajar-kampus merdeka, , Direktorat Jenderal Pendidikan Tinggi (Jakarta, Indonesia: Kemendikbud); Khadiri, K E, Labouidya, O, Kamoun, N E, Rachid, H, Success factors in a mooc massive device: Questions and challenges (2019) Journal of Theoretical and Applied Information Technology, pp. 1167-1178; Pouezevara, S R, Horn, L J, (2016) RTI Press Publication (Research Triangle Park: RTI Press) MOOCs and Online Education: Exploring the Potential for International Educational Development, pp. 1-11; Prihandoko, A C, Dafik, Agustin, I H, Implementation of super H-antimagic total graph on establishing stream cipher (2019) Indonesian Journal of Combinatorics, 3, pp. 14-23; Sabry, S S, Kaittan, N M, Ali, I M, The road to the blockchain technology: Concept and types (2019) Periodicals of Engineering and Natural Sciences, 7, pp. 1821-1832; Sarmah, S S, (2018) Understanding Blockchain Technology Computer Science and Engineering, 8, pp. 23-29; Savelyev, A, (2016) Contract Law 2.0: «Smart» Contracts As the Beginning of the End of Classic Contract Law Higher School of Economics Research Paper; Wang, S, Zhang, Y, Zhang, Y, A Blockchain-Based Framework for Data Sharing With Fine-Grained Access Control in Decentralized Storage Systems (2018) IEEE Access, 6, pp. 38437-38450; Yaga, D, Mell, P, Roby, N, Scarfone, (2018) Blockchain Technology Overview National Institute of Standards and Technology Internal Report, 66, p. 8202. , and Karen; Zhou, I, Makhdoom, I, Abolhasan, M, Lipman, J, Shariati, (2019) Conference: International Conferences on Signal Processing and Communication Systems (Gold Coast: IEEE) A Blockchain-based File-sharing System for Academic Paper Review, pp. 1-10. , and Negin",,"Dafik",,"IOP Publishing Ltd","4th International Conference on Combinatorics, Graph Theory, and Network Topology, ICCGANT 2020","22 August 2020 through 23 August 2020",,168061,17426588,,,,"English","J.

This paper draws on theWorld Health Organization (WHO)'s experience of COVID-19 knowledge-transfer to a worldwide audience of millions of learners registered on OpenWHO, WHO's massive open online course platform. It aims to illustrate the technological solutions that WHO, in collaboration with the Hasso Plattner Institute (HPI), OpenWHO's platform provider, employed in response to the unique challenges this surge in demand for learning engendered. Data on OpenWHO use, including geographic patterns and certificate attainment, were extracted from OpenWHO's internal and external reporting systems. Descriptive analysis was employed to identify trends and compare OpenWHO use with COVID-19 caseload in each WHO region. Data on the OpenWHO system load were obtained from the OpenWHO load balancer (HAProxy). The OpenWHO team responded to the need for trustworthy, evidence-based knowledge on COVID-19 via three main avenues: increased scale, targeting the needs of affected and underserved communities, and prioritising multilingualism. Each approach brought novel problems, which WHO and HPI leveraged their collaboration to meet by employing technology. This included increasing server bandwidth, expanding support teams, adding new language capabilities, and deploying functions to streamline workflows and boost learner experience.

The concept is based on the combination of new technologies and teaching methods in order to create new ideas and innovations that can enhance learning for modern learners and, at the same time, respond directly to their learning experiences. Thus, instructors are responsible for organizing the environment and creating learner-friendly learning materials using existing technology, which can lead to a digital university learning society. The contributions of this article are: 1) to synthesize the conceptual framework of the SDL MOOCs model, 2) to develop the SDL MOOCs model, 3) to develop instructional processes with self-directed learning to enhance digital literacy skills (SDL process), and 4) to study the results of developing the SDL MOOCs model. The suitability of the SDL MOOCs model was assessed by 15 experts with extensive experience in the fields of online education design and development, computer science and information and communication technologies for education. The results of this research show that: 1) the SDL MOOCs model consists of 4 main elements (input factors, instructional process, output, and feedback), 2) the SDL process consists of 4 stages (preparation, web-based self-directed learning, post-testing, and certificate approval), and 3) the developmental adequacy of the SDL MOOCs model is at a very high level. © 2021 Kassel University Press GmbH.

Although students from all over the globe register for MOOCs, only a small proportion of participants complete the online courses. MOOCs at present encounter the problem of low retention rates, thus providing numerous research gaps. This paper investigates the impact of critical factors such as the instructor’s role, course relevancy, learning outcomes on MOOCs retention. This study also analyzes the mediating role of IT (Social Media) between critical factors and MOOCs retention and provides feasible solutions for the improvement of MOOCs retention rates. Data were collected from Pakistani participants who attended, registered, or completed any MOOC. The findings of this study indicate that critical factors such as the instructor’s role, course relevancy, learning outcomes have a positive impact on MOOC participants’ retention. The results also confirm the important mediating role of IT (Social Media). The universities and the instructors who offer MOOCs should consider these critical factors when offering an online course. These critical factors can enhance MOOCs participants’ retention leading them to take the courses until certification. © 2021","Course Relevancy; COVID-19; Instructor’s role; IT (Social Media); Learning Outcome; MOOCs Retention",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Adamopoulos, P., What makes a great MOOC?

Although retention and completion rates for nonpaying users have not been promising, these statistics are much brighter for users who pay to receive a certificate upon completing the course. We investigate whether paying for the certificate option can increase engagement with course content. In particular, we consider two effects: (1) the certificate effect, which is the boost in motivation to stay engaged to receive the certificate; and (2) the sunk-cost effect, which arises solely because the user paid for the course. We use data from over 70 courses offered on the Coursera platform and study the engagement of individual participants at different milestones within each course. The panel nature of the data enables us to include controls for intrinsic differences between nonpaying and paying users in terms of their desire to stay engaged. We find evidence that the certificate and sunk-cost effects increase user engagement by approximately 8%–9% and 17%–20%, respectively. Whereas the sunk-cost effect is transient and lasts for only a few weeks after payment, the certificate effect lasts until the participant reaches the grade required to be eligible to receive the certificate. We discuss the implications of our findings for how platforms and content creators may design course milestones and schedule payment of course fees. Given that greater engagement tends to improve learning outcomes, our study serves as an important first step in understanding the role of prices and payment in enabling MOOCs to realize their full potential. © American Marketing Association 2021.","causal inference; difference-in-differences; online education; sunk-cost fallacy; user engagement",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Arkes, H.R., Blumer, C., The Psychology of Sunk Cost (1985) Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 35 (1), pp. 124-140; Breugelmans, E., Bijmolt, T.H.A., Zhang, J., Basso, L.J., Dorotic, M., Kopalle, P., Advancing Research on Loyalty Programs: A Future Research Agenda (2015) Marketing Letters, 26 (2), pp. 127-139; Brodie, R.J., Hollebeek, L.D., Jurić, B., Ilić, A., Customer Engagement: Conceptual Domain, Fundamental Propositions, and Implications for Research (2011) Journal of Service Research, 14 (3), pp. 252-271; Bruine de Bruin, W., Parker, A.M., Fischhoff, B., Individual Differences in Adult Decision-Making Competence (2007) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 92 (5), p. 938; Bruine de Bruin, W., Strough, J., Parker, A.M., Getting Older Isn’t All That Bad: Better Decisions and Coping When Facing ‘Sunk Costs,’ (2014) Psychology and Aging, 29 (3), p. 642; Carini, R.M., Kuh, G.D., Klein, S.P., Student Engagement and Student Learning: Testing the Linkages (2006) Research in Higher Education, 47 (1), pp. 1-32; Chen, T., He, T., Benesty, M., Khotilovich, V., Tang, Y., XGboost: Extreme Gradient Boosting (2015) R Package Version 0.4-2, 1 (4); Christensen, G., Steinmetz, A., Alcorn, B., Bennett, A., Woods, D., Emanuel, E., (2013) The MOOC Phenomenon: Who Takes Massive Open Online Courses and Why?, , https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2350964, working paper; Chung, D.J., Steenburgh, T., Sudhir, K., Do Bonuses Enhance Sales Productivity?

While they can opt for a traditional license, the majority of courses chooses among Creative Commons licenses. Considering the ordering in terms of degree of openness of the licenses, we study the course-, teacher- and institution-related factors driving the intellectual property decision of this pedagogical innovation. We observe that the field of study and the characteristics of the institution providing the course play a role. We explain these results by the heterogeneity in preferences and peer recognition with regard to open practices. We also find support for the idea that course providers willing to raise indirectly revenues by selling goods complementary to the MOOC (like a certificate of completion) are less likely to choose an open license. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Creative commons; Massive open online courses; Open educational resources; Open source license","E-learning; Creative Commons; Massive open online course; Open educational resources; Open license; Open source license; Related factors; Teachers'; Intellectual property",,,,,,,,,,,,"Al-Atabi, M., Deboer, J., Teaching entrepreneurship using massive open online course (MOOC) (2014) Technovation, 34, pp. 261-264; Andreoli-Versbach, P., Mueller-Langer, F., Open access to data: an ideal professed but not practiced (2014) Res.

This requires sharing a common core of knowledge to facilitate collaboration between them. To date, training in geriatric oncology has been limited in scope and difficult to access for caregivers, particularly nurses and healthcare aides. To meet this need, a massive open online course (MOOC), in geriatric oncology has been developed in France. This kind of course aims to provide simultaneous access for a large number of participants and to foster communication with the pedagogical team through discussion forums. The first session of the MOOC, which has been set up in the Occitania region of France, went online nationwide from March 6 to June 23, 2020. Despite the SARS CoV-2 global health crisis, 1020 people subscribed to the first session and 417 (40.9%) were certified at the end of the course. Most are nurses (35.2%) and work outside Occitania (56.3%). A survey revealed a high satisfaction level regarding relevance of lessons (97.9%), pedagogical quality of teaching team (97.9%), knowledge acquisition (93.6%), meeting learners' needs (90.4%) and practical value of the course (88.3%).

Design/methodology/approach: The editorial provides introspection, personal reflections and conceptualization using current literature. Findings: The authors discuss 11 drivers that are influencing graduate business education. These drivers include the demographic cliff, the K-shaped recovery, MBA degrees losing their allure, emergence of two pricing structures, the rise of online universities, certificates and micro-credentials, the massive open online course (MOOC) MBA programs, MOOCs and certification, Grow with Google, Outsourcing MBA instruction and business education relevancy. Research limitations/implications: Traditional university and college graduate business education providers must realize that the educational industry is experiencing a revolutionary disruption and that many universities will fail to meet learners’ expectations for relevant skills and organizational demands for employees who have specific skills for employability. Practical implications: Learners will no longer rely on traditional four-year universities to obtain business skills.

These platforms also bring incredible diversity of learners in terms of their traits. A research area called Author Profiling (AP in general; here, Learner Profiling (LP)), is to identify such traits about learners, which is vital in MOOCs for, e.g., preventing plagiarism, or eligibility for course certification. Identifying a learner’s trait in a MOOC is notoriously hard to do from textual content alone. We argue that to predict a learner’s academic level, we need to also be using other features stemming from MOOC platforms, such as derived from learners’ actions on the platform. In this study, we specifically examine time stamps, quizzes, and discussions. Our novel approach for the task achieves a high accuracy (90% in average) even with a simple shallow classifier, irrespective of data size, outperforming the state of the art. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Data size; Decision trees; Learner Profiling; MOOC metadata","Computer aided instruction; Distance education; Academic level; Educational levels; High-accuracy; Learning resource; Massive open online course; State of the art; Textual content; Time stamps; Intelligent vehicle highway systems",,,,,,"Acknowledgment.

However, currently there is a very low level of course purchasing (less than 1% of the total number of enrolled students on a given online course opt to purchase its certificate). This can impact seriously the business model of MOOCs. Nevertheless, MOOC research on learners’ purchasing behaviour on MOOCs remains limited. Thus, the umbrella question that this work tackles is if learner’s data can predict their purchasing decision (certification). Our fine-grained analysis attempts to uncover the latent correlation between learner activities and their decision to purchase. We used a relatively large dataset of 5 courses of 23 runs obtained from the less studied MOOC platform of FutureLearn to: (1) statistically compare the activities of non-paying learners with course purchasers, (2) predict course certification using different classifiers, optimising for this naturally strongly imbalanced dataset. Our results show that learner activities are good predictors of course purchasibility; still, the main challenge was that of early prediction. Using only student number of step accesses, attempts, correct and wrong answers, our model achieve promising accuracies, ranging between 0.81 and 0.95 across the five courses. The outcomes of this study are expected to help design future courses and predict the profitability of future runs; it may also help determine what personalisation features could be provided to increase MOOC revenue. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Certification prediction; Learner analytics; MOOCs","Classification (of information); Computer aided instruction; E-learning; Forecasting; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Large dataset; Sales; Students; Business modeling; Content providers; Early prediction; Fine-grained analysis; Imbalanced dataset; Massive open online course; Personalisation; Purchasing decisions; Curricula",,,,,,,,,,,,"Ng, A., Widom, J., Origins of the modern MOOC (XMOOC) (2014) Moocs: Expectations and Reality: Full Report, pp. 34-47. , Hollands, F.M., Tirthali, D.

Through using data mining technology to mine the learning behaviours from five dimensions: video watching, text reading, discussion and communication, test and assignments taking, we draw the following conclusions: the demographic characteristics of learners show that the learners are mainly composed of principals, middle-level educational managers and key teachers. The learner's general learning behaviour characteristics are mainly expressed by the facts that the learners' interest in practical cases, and few participants can last more than four weeks, and the learners like videos and texts but they do not like to speak in the discussion forum. Learners can be divided into three clusters: certificate-oriented learners, practice oriented learners and browsers. The value of MOOC should not be evaluated on the basis of certification rates but on whether the learner's learning needs are met.

We performed a network-based analysis of student achievement, considering how course-course interactions may positively or negatively affect student success. Our data set included 378, 000 users and 1, 000, 000 unique registration events in France Universite Numerique (FUN), a national MOOC platform. We adapt reliability theory to model certificate completion rates with a Weibull survival function, following the intuition that students ""survive""in a course for a certain time before stochastically dropping out. Course-course interactions are found to be well described by a single parameter for user engagement that can be estimated from a user's registration profile. User engagement, in turn, correlates with certificate rates in all courses regardless of specific content. The reliability approach is shown to capture several certificate rate patterns that are overlooked by conventional regression models. User engagement emerges as a natural metric for tracking student progress across demographics and over time. © 2021 Wintermute et al.",,"achievement; article; demography; France; human; intuition; reliability; stochastic model; academic success; adolescent; adult; education; female; male; student; theoretical model; Academic Success; Adolescent; Adult; Education, Distance; Female; France; Humans; Male; Models, Theoretical; Students",,,,,"Fondation Bettencourt Schueller; Chulabhorn Research Institute, CRI","This work was supported by the Bettencourt Schueller Foundation through a CRI Research Fellowship to EHW.

A number of MOOC learners engage in most or all course activities but fail to pass the course. To improve participation and thereby increase successful completion, this study explores the behavioural differences between certificate achievers and explorers that lead to their different learning outcomes. Eleven behaviours were extracted from more than 80,000 behaviour records for 215 certificate achievers and 456 explorers, which were categorized into four types of activities: graded assessment, content-related, course-related, and interactive activities. Random forest classifier, independent-sample t-testing, and lag sequential analysis were used. The results showed six important behaviours that are highly related to certificate achievement. Certificate achievers engaged in more course-related and graded assessment activities during the course, while explorers engaged in more content-related and interactive activities, and graded assessment activities occurring at the end of the course. Compared to explorers, certificate achievers exhibited more bidirectional behaviours in terms of interactive and course-related activities and more repeated behaviours in terms of course-related and graded assessment activities. The study has significant implications for MOOC learners and instructors in improving learning and teaching performance by implementing appropriate behavioural interventions. © 2021 National Institute of Education, Singapore.","academic performance; Behaviour differences; behaviour sequence; certificate achievers; explorers; MOOCs",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Aldowah, H., Al-Samarraie, H., Alzahrani, A.I., Alalwan, N., Factors affecting student dropout in MOOCs: A cause and effect decision-making model (2020) Journal of Computing in Higher Education, 32, pp. 429-454; Al-Shabandar, R., Hussain, A., Laws, A., Keight, R., Lunn, J., Radi, N., Machine learning approaches to predict learning outcomes in Massive open online courses (2017) Proceedings of 2017 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN), pp. 713-720. , May, &,.

In the last decade, distance technologies (including the format of massive open online courses - MOOCs) have occupied an increasingly significant place in the higher education system. The sphere of teaching foreign languages, in particular, Russian as a foreign language (RFL), is no exception. Currently, knowledge of the basics of modern distance educational technologies and the ability to apply them in the educational process is the most important component of the RFL teacher's professiogram. The purpose of this study is to assess the level of readiness of RFL teachers to use existing MOOCs and create their own online courses. Materials and research methods. An analysis of the regulatory framework for professional certification of higher education teachers and an analysis of scientific sources devoted to the content of the ICT competence of an RFL teacher are applied. The survey involved 50 RFL teachers from various universities in St. Petersburg. Research results. It was found that there is a significant gap between the required content of the RFL teacher's professiogram in the field of ICT competence and the level of readiness of RFL teachers to use ready-made MOOCs and create their own online courses. Only 11% of those surveyed used MOOCs in their professional activities, and only 38% themselves studied with the help of such courses. 42% and 52% of respondents are ready to use ready-made MOOCs and create their own courses, respectively. The effectiveness of MOOCs in teaching RFL is rated highly by only 37% of respondents, another 34% rate it as average and 29% as low. Discussion of results and conclusion. The existence of this gap is explained by the fact that the professional training of RFL teachers in the field of ICT competence does not always keep pace with the changes in the field of modern educational technologies. In addition, not all teachers see the expediency of using MOOCs in the process of teaching RFL, since language learning requires communication practice, and MOOCs are more often used to convey the theoretical aspects of a particular discipline. Despite this, many RFL teachers have shown an active desire to use ready-made online courses and create their own, subject to the passage of appropriate training, the availability of information and technical support for specialists in online education, as well as material and legal support from the university administration. © 2020 LLC Ecological Help.

This paper presents findings obtained when conducting the effects of the use of MOOCs in fostering learning and teaching strategies in rural communities of South Africa. The survey research design of descriptive nature was adopted to evaluate the awareness and usage of Massive Open Online Course (MOOCs) in Alice community, Eastern Cape, South Africa. This study also employed a quantitative approach by using a self-structured questionnaire to evoke information from the respondents. We used the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) to analyze the data collected. The study revealed, amongst others, the efficacy of MOOCs in fostering teaching and learning in marginalized rural areas. This study concludes that MOOCs is a veritable medium for busy or less privileged individual to acquire a degree or certification. Therefore, the study recommends MOOCs platform to be fully embraced by people in marginalized rural areas, awareness programs about its usefulness should be propagated across the municipalities nationwide. © 2020 IEEE.","distance learning; information and communication technology; massive open online course; online learning; teaching and learning","Curricula; Rural areas; Surveys; Teaching; Awareness program; Learning and teachings; Massive open online course; Online learning; Quantitative approach; Statistical packages; Teaching and learning; Teaching methods; E-learning",,,,,,,,,,,,"Lane, A., McAndrew, P., Are open educational resources systematic or systemic change agents for teaching practice?

The course is divided into five “weeks” highlighting the importance of radiochemistry and nuclear chemistry for environment, health, industry, nuclear energy and society. Each week consists of different modules covering all possible applications of NRC within the week topic. The module follows a pedagogical framework designed ad hoc, that gradually introduces the topic to students, giving them different examples and applications to understand the theoretical concepts and to acquire a technical terminology. Feedback obtained by the pilot edition showed very good results: despite the short duration of the course, 25% of the 203 users successfully completed the course achieving the Certificate of Accomplishment. The answers collected in the inital survey and the final customer satisfaction questionnaire showed that users belonged to the selected target group and greatly appreciated the presence of practical examples and the different lesson formats adopted. The MOOC objective of attracting new students towards NRC appears to be on a good track, however this can only be confirmed by monitoring the next MOOC editions. © 2020 Societa Italiana di Fisica.

It also enables students’ access to professors and educational contents sans spatial and institutional barriers. Despite several benefits, MOOCs’ adoption and completion rate remain unimpressive, especially among developing countries. Using Extended Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2), we examine the key factors that influence the behavioral intention to use MOOCs among students in an Indian private university. The data from 412 postgraduate students were analyzed using Partial Least Squares-Structured Equation Modelling. The study identifies barriers to use MOOCs, in a university that has offered free MOOCs courses and certifications to the students.

However, this mode of education still has many problems in terms of credibility, credit certification and certificates, student privacy, and various courses. The accepted question addressed was whether universities would discuss blockchain technology differently from traditional research and education. Through a research approach, literature summary and case analysis as well as Business Model Canvas which provides three theoretical contributions and guidance on what Blockchain is by taking sponsored studies. This study shows the results that integrating blockchain technology with the MOOC-based Smart Program Education platform is a trend that is promised on the Internet of online education development. The conclusion can provide a critique of the technical features and basic applications of Blockchain and provide solutions to online education problems based on Blockchain technology. Assistance, discussion, discussion on blockchain and discussion on how educational institutions work must be approved by Blockchain technology as digital technology, so that more can be expected in prototypes and will be developed to provide a better replacement. © 2020 IEEE.","Blockchain; Business Model Canvas; MOOC; Online Course; Ontology; Smart-courses","Air navigation; Blockchain; Curricula; Education computing; Engineering education; Intelligent systems; Basic application; Business modeling; Digital technologies; Educational institutions; Internet technology; On-line education; Research approach; Technical features; E-learning",,,,,,,,,,,,"Grech, A., Camilleri, A.F., (2017) Blockchain in Education, , Inamorato dos Santos, A.

This mixed-methods study addresses this question by examining one of the first MOOC-based blended professional degree programs, which admitted students to an accelerated residential master's program on the basis of performance in MOOCs and a proctored exam. We found that male students and students with master's degrees were more likely to complete the online program and the blended program had more male students and more students with master's degrees than students in the existing residential program. Students who enrolled in the blended graduate program earned higher average grades than students in the residential program earned in their in-person courses (3.86 vs 3.75, p <.01). The findings of this study provide an example of how new online learning models can serve particular niches, but may not address broader equity challenges. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Access; Admissions; MOOCs; Online learning; Professional education","E-learning; Housing; Professional aspects; Certificate programs; Graduate program; Massive open online course; Online learning; Online programs; Professional degree; Residential programs; Under-represented groups; Students",,,,,,"We are grateful to the research assistants, Lauren Oh and Elizabeth Weeks, who contributed to this work.

This attracts a large number of learners, each with their own individual intentions and motivations to join a course. However, personal support and guidance can almost never be provided at this scale. All learners have to follow the same usually weekly structured content and the learning success is only measured by the achievement of a certificate. To overcome this one-size-fits-all approach with technical means, we introduced a tool for Personalized Learning Objectives. This enables learners to achieve more individual objectives in courses, follow different learning paths, and link their motivations and intentions to the definition of learning success. Previous studies have already examined, among other aspects, the usefulness, acceptance, and achievement rates of learning objectives in MOOCs. In this complimentary research, the satisfaction of students with and without a selected learning objective is compared in a course on topics from the field of Design Thinking. © 2020 IEEE.","E-Learning; Goal-Oriented Learning; Learning Objectives; MOOCs; Self-Regulated Learning","Distance education; Motivation; Design thinking; Free access; Learning objectives; Learning paths; Massive open online course; Personalized learning; Students' satisfaction; Curricula",,,,,,,,,,,,"Margaryan, A., Bianco, M., Littlejohn, A., Instructional quality of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) (2015) Computers & Education, 80, pp. 77-83. , http://dx.doi.Org/10.1016/j.compedu.2014.08.005, January; Kizilcec, R.F., Schneider, E., Motivation as a Lens to Understand Online Learners: Toward Data-Driven Design with the OLEI Scale (2015) Acm Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction, 22. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2699735, March; Zheng, S., Rosson, M.B., Shih, P.C., Carroll, J.M., Understanding Student Motivation, Behaviors and Perceptions in MOOCs (2015) Proceedings of the 18th Acm Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work & Social Computing (CSCW '15), pp. 1882-1895. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2675133.2675217, February; Broadbent, J., Poon, W.L., Self-regulated learning strategies & academic achievement in online higher education learning environments: A systematic review (2015) The Internet and Higher Education, 27, pp. 1-13. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.iheduc.2015.04.007, October; Henderikx, M., Kreijns, K., Kalz, M., Refining success and dropout in massive open online courses based on the intention-behavior gap (2017) Distance Education, 38 (3), pp. 353-368. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01587919.2017.1369006, September; Lee, D., Watson, S.L., Watson, W.R., Systematic literature review on self-regulated learning in massive open online courses (2019) Australasian Journal of Educational Technology, 35 (1). , http://dx.doi.org/10.14742/ajet.3749, March; Rohloff, T., Meinel, C., Towards Personalized Learning Objectives in MOOCs (2018) Lifelong Technology-Enhanced Learning, pp. 202-215. , https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-98572-516, August; Rohloff, T., Sauer, D., Meinel, C., On the Acceptance and Usefulness of Personalized Learning Objectives in MOOCs Proceedings of the Sixth (2019) Acm Conference on Learning @ Scale (L@S '19), , http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3330430.3333624, June 2019; Rohloff, T., Sauer, D., Meinel, C., Students' Achievement of Personalized Learning Objectives in MOOCs Proceedings of the Seventh (2020) Acm Conference on Learning @ Scale (L@S '20), , http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3386527.3405918, August 2020; Pintrich, P.R., The Role of Goal Orientation in Self-Regulated Learning (2000) Handbook of Self-Regulation, pp. 451-502. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-012109890-2/50043-3; Steere, D.E., Cavaiuolo, D., Connecting Outcomes, Goals, and Objectives in Transition Planning (2002) Teaching Exceptional Children, 34 (6), pp. 54-59. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/004005990203400608, July; Krathwohl, D.R., A Revision of Bloom's Taxonomy: An Overview (2002) Theory into Practice, 41 (4), pp. 212-218. , https://doi.org/10.1207/s15430421tip4104_2; Doran, G.T., There's a SMART way to write management's goals and objectives (1981) Management Review, 70 (11), pp. 35-36",,,"Class Central;edX;IBL News","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","2020 IEEE Learning With MOOCS, LWMOOCS 2020","30 September 2020 through 2 October 2020",,164531,,9781728197289,,,"English","Proc.

Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative–quantitative study of correlational and descriptive scope is carried out on two instruments based on pre- and post-tests of 6,029 participants, which is followed by a qualitative data analysis distributed by code families to identify participants’ main motivations to take MOOCs. Findings: The results showed a positive moderate-high correlation between expectancy-value and achievement goals, which means in a practical sense that the participants’ subjective estimates of the possibility of reaching their goals prior to the beginning of the course were fulfilled, as the intentionality of the subjects-participants was positive with respect to the contents imparted. Practical implications: The profiles of participants with a higher tendency to successfully finish the course and with high rates of engagement share the following characteristics: having previously and successfully finished more than one MOOC; taking the MOOC for work purposes (promotion, seeking better job opportunities, etc.); and having intrinsic motivation, that is, not depending on external factors such as obligations and certifications. Originality/value: This research suggests that there are pre-educational factors that define the trend of successful completion of MOOCs, based on expectancy-value (e.g. previous experiences with other MOOCs) and achievement goals (e.g. job improvement), with external motivational issues such as completion certificates being less prevalent in the learning intention. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","E-Learning; Engagement; Motivation",,,,,,"S0019201401","This research has been realized in the framework of Project 266632 “Laboratorio Binacional para la Gestión Inteligente de la Sustentabilidad Energética y la Formación Tecnológica” (Binational Laboratory for the Intelligent Management of the Energy Sustainability and the Technological Formation), with financing of energy sustainability fund CONACYT-SENER (Agreement: S0019201401).",,,,,,"Admiraal, W., Huisman, B., Pilli, O., Assessment in massive open online courses (2015) The Electronic Journal of e-Learning, 13 (4), pp. 207-216; Barak, M., Watted, A., Haick, H., Motivation to learn in massive open online courses: examining aspects of language and social engagement (2016) Computers and Education, 94 (1), pp. 49-60; Beltrán Hernández de Galidno, M.J., Romero-Rodríguez, L.M., Ramírez Montoya, M.S., Entrepreneurship competencies in energy sustainability MOOCs (2019) Journal of Entrepreneurship in Emerging Economies, 11 (4), pp. 598-616; Bonk, C.J., Lee, M.M., Kou, X., Xu, S., Sheu, F.R., Understanding the self-directed online learning preferences, goals, achievements, and challenges of MIT OpenCourseWare subscribers (2015) Educational Technology and Society, 18 (2), pp. 349-368; Castaño, C., Maiz, I., Garay, U., Design, motivation and performance in a cooperative MOOC course (2015) Comunicar, 22 (44), pp. 19-26; Colman, A., (2016) A Dictionary of Psychology, , Oxford University Press, Oxford; Colquitt, J.A., LePine, J.A., Noe, R.A., Toward an integrative theory of training motivation: a Meta-analytic path analysis of 20 years of research (2002) Journal of Applied Psychology, 85 (5), pp. 678-707; Daniel, J., Making sense of MOOCs: Musings in a maze of myth, paradox and possibility (2012) Journal of Interactive Media in Education, 2012 (3), pp. 1-20; de Barba, P.G., Kennedy, G.E., Ainley, M.D., The role of students’ motivation and participation in predicting performance in a MOOC (2016) Journal of Computer Assisted Learning, 32 (3), pp. 218-231; Eccles, J.S., Wigfield, A., Motivational beliefs, values, and goals (2002) Annual Review of Psychology, 53 (1), pp. 109-132; Elliot, A.J., McGregor, H.A., A 2 x 2 achievement goal framework (2001) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 80 (3), pp. 501-519; Esposito, A., Research ethics in emerging forms of online learning: Issues arising from a hypothetical study on a MOOC (2012) The Electronic Journal of e-Learning, 10 (3), pp. 315-325; Gabel, M., (2013) Massive Open Online Courses, , https://eua.eu/resources/publications/680:moocs-massive-open-online-courses.html, European University: accessed 26 October 2019; García Espinosa, B.J., Tenorio Sepúlveda, G.C., Ramírez-Montoya, M.S., Self-motivation challenges for student involvement in the open educational movement with MOOC (2015) RUSC.

Design/methodology/approach: The primary data were collected from the field surveys conducted in the universities and academic institutions located in National Capital Region of Delhi, India, using convenience sampling technique. Structural equation modelling was used to test the hypothesized relationships in the proposed model. Findings: The findings indicate that the learners’ intention to adopt MOOCs is significantly influenced by intrinsic motivation, social recognition, perceived value and perceived usefulness. On the other hand, the personal readiness, self-regulation of learners and peer influence are not found to have any significant impact on MOOCs adoption intention. Practical implications: The findings of the study will be helpful for MOOCs providers and other stakeholders. The MOOCs providers should emphasize on providing courses from renowned universities in cutting-edge areas which are self-paced and cost-effective. The academic institutions should provide credit benefits to the students in lieu of completing courses through MOOCs. Likewise, employers should also recognize the certificates awarded by MOOCs and give due credit to the learners who complete such certifications. Originality/value: The study has contributed to the existing literature on MOOCs adoption by combining constructs from TUE and SDT. To the best of the author’s knowledge, this has been a first attempt to combine these two frameworks to study the learners’ adoption behaviour for MOOCs in Indian context. The integration of these two frameworks provides a more comprehensive model of factors with increased explanatory ability (72.6 per cent) to describe the adoption intention of MOOCs. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Adoption; Massive open online courses (MOOCs); Massive open online courses MOOCs; Self-determination theory; Technology-user-environment",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abdekhoda, M., Dehnad, A., Mirsaeed, S.J.G., Gavgani, V.Z., Factors influencing the adoption of E-learning in Tabriz university of medical sciences (2016) Medical Journal of the Islamic Republic Of Iran, 30 (457), pp. 1-7; Abu-Shanab, E., Musleh, S., The adoption of massive open online courses: challenges and benefits (2018) International Journal of Web-Based Learning and Teaching Technologies, 13 (4), pp. 62-76; (2018) All India survey of higher education, , https://epsiindia.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/AISHE-2017-18.pdf; Alonso-Mencía, M.E., Alario-Hoyos, C., Maldonado-Mahauad, J., Estévez-Ayres, I., Pérez-Sanagustín, M., Kloos, C.D., Self-regulated learning in MOOCs: lessons learned from a literature review (2019) Educational Review, pp. 1-27; Alraimi, K.M., Zo, H., Ciganek, A.P., Understanding the MOOCs continuance: the role of openness and reputation (2015) Computers and Education, 80, pp. 28-38. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2014.08.006, (January; Altbach, P.G., MOOCs as neocolonialism: who controls knowledge?

Thousands of students with different social and cultural backgrounds from all over the world can enroll for a course. This diverse audience comes with varying motivations and intentions from their personal or professional life. However, course instructors cannot offer individual support and guidance at this scale and therefore usually provide a one-size-fits-all approach. Students have to follow weekly-structured courses and their success is measured with the achievement of a certificate at the end. To better address the varying learning needs, technical support for goal-oriented and self-regulated learning is desired but very limited to date. Both learning strategies are proven to be key factors for students' achievement in large-scale online learning environments. Therefore, this paper presents a continuative study of personalized learning objectives in MOOCs to encourage goal-oriented and self-regulated learning. Based on the previously well-perceived acceptance and usefulness of the concept of personalized learning objectives, this study examines which learners select an objective and how successful they complete objectives. Concerning the learners' socio-demographic and geographical background, we could not identify any practical significant difference between students with selected learning objectives and the total course population. However, we have identified promising objective achievement rates, and we have observed a practical significant improvement of the certification rates comparing the total course population and students who selected an objective that included a graded certificate. This has also demonstrated a method for calculating more reasonable completion rates in MOOCs. © 2020 ACM.","learning objectives; moocs; self-regulated learning","Air navigation; Computer aided instruction; Curricula; Students; Cultural backgrounds; Learning objectives; Massive open online course; Online learning environment; Personalized learning; Professional life; Self-regulated learning; Technical support; E-learning",,,,,,,,,,,,"Breslow, L.B., Pritchard, D.E., DeBoer, J., Stump, G.S., Ho, A.D., Seaton, D.T., Studying learning in the worldwide classroom: Research into edx's first mooc (2013) Research & Practice in Assessment, 8, pp. 13-25. , http://www.rpajournal.com/dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/SF2.pdf, 2013; Broadbent, J., Poon, W., Self-regulated learning strategies & academic achievement in online higher education learning environments: A systematic review (2015) The Internet and Higher Education, 27 (4). , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.iheduc.2015.04.007, 2015; Doran, G.T., There's a smart way to write management's goals and objectives (1981) Management Review, 70 (11), pp. 35-36. , 1981; Grella, C., Meinel, C., Moocs as a promoter of gender diversity in stem?

Because MOOCs are open to anyone with computer access and rarely have prerequisite requirements, the range of student backgrounds can be far more varied than in conventional classroom-based courses. Prior studies have shown that misconceptions have a huge impact on students' learning performance; however, no study has empirically examined the relationship between misconceptions and learning persistence. This study of 12,913 MOOC-takers examines how students' misconceptions about the upcoming course material affect course completion. Using a survival analysis approach, we found that, controlling for the score in a pre-course test, students holding more misconceptions had a higher dropout rate at the start of the course, an effect that diminished over time. Other student variables were found to have a positive impact on survival that persisted throughout the entire course: U.S. location, higher age, an intention to complete, better English skills, prior familiarity with the subject, motivation to earn a certificate, and score and time spent on the previous problem set (homework). By contrast, student gender, education level, number of previous MOOCs completed, and motivation to participate in online discussion forums did not affect survival. © 2019 The Authors.

This study is focused on MOOC-takers behavior obtained from a seven-week MOOC experience on natural risks. Data scraping principles have been used to collect data. Demographics, success-dropout rates, engagement periods, achievement and scoring, and behavior were analyzed through descriptive statistics, non-parametric correlation analysis, and statistical hypothesis testing. The results show that students who start earlier and those who finish earlier the course obtain better grades in some of the modules (motivation and background on natural risks could be the explanation). However, for 'last moment students', speed in passing the modules is either related to greater motivation, although in this case it is not related to better grades. Furthermore, students who complete tasks during the weekend take less time to complete the modules and obtain a better grade. In addition, a learning strategy is promoted by reconsidering who is learning: players (those who complete the course and earning a certificate), auditors (those who have completed a thematic unit or the whole module, earning partial knowledge), and spectators (those enrolled until the end of the course, who intend earning experience in e-learning). © 2020 by the authors.","Behavior; ELearning; Geography; Massive open online courses; Natural risks; Success","correlation; hypothesis testing; learning; numerical model; risk assessment; student",,,,,"Universidad de Alicante: BOUA 07/11/2018, E8791","Funding: This research was funded by the Vice-Rector’s Office for Quality and Educational Innovation of the University of Alicante, grant number E8791, BOUA 07/11/2018, of the PENSEM-ONLINE Program.",,,,,,"Baggaley, J., Online learning: A new testament (2014) Distance Educ., 35, pp. 133-140; Witthaus, G., Inamorato dos Santos, A., Childs, M., Tannhäuser, A., Conole, G., Nkuyubwatsi, B., Punie, Y., Validation of non-formal MOOC-based learning: An analysis of assessment and recognition practices in Europe (OpenCred), , EUR 27660 EN 2016; Moural, V.F., Souzal, C.A., Oliveira-Neto, J.D., Viana, A.B.N., MOOC's potential for democratizing education: An analysis from the perspective of access to technology (2017) EMCIS 2017, pp. 139-153. , Themistocleous, M., Morabito, V., Eds.; University of Coimbra: Coimbra, Portugal; Thomas, L., Herbert, J., Teras, M., A sense of belonging to enhance participation, success and retention in online programs (2014) Int.

The “Humanizing Online Teaching and Learning” or HumanMOOC was offered four times with 2,614 participants overall and covered topics on the elements of the Community of Inquiry framework: social presence, teaching presence, and cognitive presence. Through phenomenological inquiry, literature review, demographics, and interviews, the researchers gathered and analyzed information from learners who completed the HumanMOOC. Three themes of the interviews that emerged from the coding analysis process are: learning journeyers, I think I can, and bringing it back to the classroom. The intention to participate and to overcome barriers and the increase in self-efficacy as a result of personal accomplishment, impacted the participants’ will to implement what was learned into their teaching practice. © 2020, The Online Learning Consortium.

There is flexibility and space for study in MOOCs. It provides opportunities to students and scholars by providing low cost courses. MOOCs are made by sequence of videos, classes offered to students. Colleges and universities are espousing some diff erent stands towards pursuing with MOOCs and it helps in achieving numerous goals. This paper aims to study role of MOOCs among students of college and uni versity and in which way they use it, whether to gain knowledge or just to fulfil the criteria of course. As a part of the study, a survey will be taken from technical and non-technical students to assess the impact of MOOC.

To advance our understanding of how people learn in MOOCs, we investigate the intersection between learning design and the temporal process of engagement in the course. This study investigates the detailed processes of engagement using educational process mining in a FutureLearn science course (N = 2086 learners) and applying an established taxonomy of learning design to classify learning activities. The analyses were performed on three groups of learners categorised based upon their clicking behaviour. The process-mining results show at least one dominant pathway in each of the three groups, though multiple popular additional pathways were identified within each group. All three groups remained interested and engaged in the various learning and assessment activities. The findings from this study suggest that in the analysis of voluminous MOOC data there is value in first clustering learners and then investigating detailed progressions within each cluster that take the order and type of learning activities into account. The approach is promising because it provides insight into variation in behavioural sequences based on learners’ intentions for earning a course certificate. These insights can inform the targeting of analytics-based interventions to support learners and inform MOOC designers about adapting learning activities to different groups of learners based on their goals. © 2019, The Author(s).","Educational process mining; Learning design; MOOCs",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Baker, R., Evans, B., Dee, T., A randomized experiment testing the efficacy of a scheduling nudge in a massive open online course (MOOC) (2016) AERA Open, 2 (4); Baker, R.S., Inventado, P.S., Educational data mining and learning analytics (2014) Learning Analytics, pp. 61-75. , http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-1-4614-3305-7_4, Retrieved from; Bannert, M., Reimann, P., Sonnenberg, C., Process mining techniques for analysing patterns and strategies in students’ self-regulated learning (2014) Metacognition and Learning, 9 (2), pp. 161-185; Bogarín, A., Cerezo, R., Romero, C., A survey on educational process mining (2018) Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, 8 (1); Conole, G., (2012) Designing for learning in an open world, 4. , Springer, Berlin; Cross, S., Conole, G., (2009) Learn about Learning Design.

Termed massive open online courses (MOOCs), these soon fell into different categories, depending on their concept. Among them are connectivist massive open online courses (cMOOCs) which emphasise a collaborative approach to learning. However, while initial enrolment is indeed massive, completion rates are very low and cMOOCs notoriously lack an appropriate method of evaluating learning progress and motivational resources. The author of this article suggests that one way of addressing this problem might be to adapt motivational formative assessment tools used in massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) to cMOOCs. He argues that some characteristics of MMORPGs can be effectively incorporated in cMOOCs, thus benefiting from the motivational potential of MMORPGs. He cautions, however, that even if MMORPGs (and ongoing, low-stakes formative assessment in general) are motivational, they can only be applied to cMOOCs if the idea of formative assessment is not in tension with connectivist principles. Hence, the author argues for their compatibility, and builds on peer-to-peer assessment as a solution for resource allocation problems with low instructor–learner ratio. © 2020, The Author(s).","Connectivism; Connectivist massive open online courses (cMOOCs); Formative assessment; Gamification; Massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs); Motivation","assessment method; higher education; learning; virtual reality",,,,,"Budapesti Műszaki és Gazdaságtudományi Egyetem, BME","Open access funding provided by Budapest University of Technology and Economics (BME).

Indian Government has launched its own indigenous MOOC platform SWAYAM (Study Webs of Active-Learning for Young Aspiring Minds). The objective of introduction of SWAYAM courses is to provide easy access, equity and quality education to all. The success of SWAYAM portal depends on awareness about this portal among the possible users and its scope in enhancing lifelong learning skills. This study examines the awareness of MOOCs and SWAYAM platform among students of Commerce and factors influencing utilization of SWAYAM/ MOOCs by students. The study reveals low awareness of SWAYAM MOOCs among Commerce students although a positive attitude towards learning through SWAYAM MOOCs is observed. One of the major factors influencing utilization of MOOCs as a learning tool was lack of ability to use ICT skills. Lack of classroom teaching and one to one contact with educators was also perceived as a constraint in learning through MOOCs. The study concluded that there is a need to encourage students to adopt MOOCs as a learning resource. This will need collaborative effort between Government, all national coordinators of SWAYAM, Universities and also Industry Academia interactions to promote acceptability of certification provided by SWAYAM in job market. © 2020 IJSTR.","Awareness; Commerce; ICT; MHRD; MOOCs; Online Courses; Students; SWAYAM",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abeer, W., Miri, B., Students' preferences and views about learning in a MOOC (2014) Procedia-Social and Behavioral Sciences, 152, pp. 318-323; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877042814052707; (2019) About Swayam, , https://swayam.gov.in/; Baker, D.M., Unni, R., USA and Asia Hospitality & Tourism Students‘ Perceptions and Satisfaction with Online Learning versus Traditional Face-to-Face Instruction (2018) E-Journal of Business Education & Scholarship of Teaching, 12 (2), pp. 40-54. , September, Retrieved from; https://search.proquest.com/docview/2125614267?accountid=144497; Baturay, M.H., An overview of the world of MOOCs (2015) Procedia-Social and Behavioral Sciences, 174, pp. 427-433. , 2015; Cole, A.W., Timmerman, C.E., What Do Current College Students Think about MOOCs?

However, there is limited and conflicting research on MOOCs and labor market outcomes. Using two randomized control trials, we test Amazon’s Mechanical Turk respondents’ preferences for hiring hypothetical freelance web developers. In the first experiment, we examine preferences for profiles with MOOCs as compared to profiles with traditional degrees (bachelor’s, associates, and community college certificates). Respondents preferred all traditional degrees over a MOOC; MOOCs do not serve as substitutes for traditional postsecondary credentials. In the second experiment, we examine preferences for MOOCs as compared to no listed credential. Results demonstrate a 61–percentage point preference for MOOC credentials compared to no MOOC credential; the preference does not vary across levels of professional experience. © The Author(s) 2020.","economics of education; educational policy; experimental design; higher education; postsecondary education; regression analyses",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Agrawal, A., Horton, J., Lacetera, N., Lyons, E., Digitization and the contract labor market: A research agenda (2015) Economic analysis of the digital economy, pp. 219-250. , https://doi.org/10.7208/chicago/9780226206981.003.0008, Goldfarb A., Greenstein S., Tucker C.E., (eds), University of Chicago Press, (Eds.), (., –; Bai, H., (2018) Evidence that a large amount of low quality responses on MTurk can be detected with repeated GPS coordinates, , https://www.maxhuibai.com/blog/evidence-that-responses-from-repeating-gps-are-random, August, 8; Becker, G.S., Investment in human capital: A theoretical analysis (1962) Journal of Political Economy, 70, pp. 9-49. , https://doi.org/10.1086/258724, (5, Part 2; Bertrand, M., Mullainathan, S., Are Emily and Greg more employable than Lakisha and Jamal?

It also endeavours to stimulate lifelong learning which would transform learners' lives and contribute to their continuing success. The Covid-19 pandemic has pushed all UK universities to online learning and assessment since March 2020. Accordingly, e-learning is becoming increasingly more important and is likely to maintain high levels of adoption in future. LinkedIn Learning (LiL), became a subsidiary of LinkedIn, the world's largest professional network, after it acquired Lynda.com in 2016. It is an e-learning platform offering over 15,000 Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) delivered by industry experts in 7 languages. It is accompanied by exercise files and assessments, and transcripts for the video. A completion certificate for a LiL course will be posted on the learner's LinkedIn profile if they or their institution have a subscription to LiL. Aligned with the aim of UK higher education, LiL is designed to help learners enrich their learning, better their careers and support lifelong learning. Accordingly, LiL has become a popular MOOCs e-learning portal and been widely adopted by UK Higher Education Institutions (HEIs). This paper reports ten 2nd year Master's students LiL experiences on an Advanced Business Research module in a UK HEI. LiL was used as a blended learning tool and formed part of the module's summative assessment. The embedded LiL courses corresponded to the module content and focused on technical tools and software applications widely applied in business research. They include Endnote reference management software, Survey Monkey and Microsoft Forms for online survey design, SPSS for quantitative data analysis and NVivo for qualitative data analysis. In this paper, 10 students' reflective portfolios on their completed LiL courses were analysed within NVivo. Constant comparative analysis was employed within a three-stage coding process in order to generate grounded theories. Results demonstrate students' positive e-learning experience and perceived LiL benefits in enhancing their research skills and employability. This research implies that LiL MOOCs could be used as an effective e-learning educational platform and blended learning pedagogy under the current Covid-19 pandemic situation and in the future. © 2020 Academic Conferences Limited.

People around the world use MOOCs to train their already acquired skills or gain new ones through the worldwide web. Both educational institutions and official training providers use MOOCs to enhance the standard educational process through online learning. This paper studies the potential usage of MOOCs as a part of formal education in Romania, with proper recognition and accreditation from universities, the labour market, and quality assurance institutions. Using existing successful platforms from MIT and Harvard that offer online credentials, the paper focuses on possible implementation in Romania. The exploratory research is based on a qualitative approach, using individual interviews at faculty level in different Romanian universities, conducted with teaching staff and students. Given the different profiles and study fields of universities, there needs to be a correlation between the demand of the labour market and the offer of these courses and programs. The findings will provide a general point of view on the future of MOOCs in accredited and recognized education and training. Given the advancements made in the online education sector and digital skills in particular, these courses will become the foundation of lifelong training in the future. Teaching staff and universities need to be aware of the growing need for digital skills that can be acquired and enhanced through e-learning platforms that do not only help learners to graduate but give them the possibility of recognition in terms of accredited certificates. © 2020, National Defence University-Carol I Printing House.

The purpose of the article is twofold. On the one hand, to describe the evaluation system implemented during three editions in the MOOC ""Digital Literacy for groups at risk of social exclusion: Strategies for Socio-educational Intervention."" (European Project ECO). On the other hand, we analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the assessment system described. We have designed the evaluative model as a central and dynamic part of pedagogical design, allowing us to know our virtual participants (initial evaluation), to tutor their work and to evaluate their results (assesment of learning processes) and, finally, to obtain information in order to take decisions for improvement in each new edition (evaluation oriented to improvement). First of all, we describe the evaluation model. Then we analyze the main data collected with the tools used (initial questionnaire, interactions in Facebook groups and other social spaces, self-evaluation questionnaires, peer to peer evaluation, key informants and platform data). Finally, we discuss the results obtained in order to provide reflections that can guide the design of evaluation processes in MOOC. The main thesis we defend is that the planning of the evaluative model is a central element that must be outlined from minute one and be fully integrated with the rest of elements of the pedagogical design. Evaluative model should contemplate strategies for the initial and formative assessment of the participants and of the teaching-learning process itself, and not only be based on the final assessment oriented towards certification. © 2020 Grupo de Investigacion FORCE.

Even though they provide several benefits, there are still some criticisms of MOOCs. For instance, MOOCs' high dropout rates or predominantly elite participation are considered to be important problems. In order to develop solutions for these problems, a deeper understanding of MOOCs is required. Today, despite the availability of several research studies about MOOCs, there is a shortage of in-depth research on course characteristics, learner characteristics, and predictors of certification rates. This study examined MOOC and learner characteristics in detail and explored the predictors of course certification rates based on data from 122 Massachusetts Institute of Technology MOOCs (MITx) on edX platform as well as data about the 2.8 million participants registered in these MOOCs. The results indicated that as the number of courses offered and the number of learners enrolled increased in years, there was a decrease in the certification rates among enrolled learners. According to our results, the number of average chapters completed, total forum messages, and mean age predicted course certification rates positively. On the other hand, the total number of chapters in a course predicted the course certification rates negatively. Based on these results, shorter and more interactive MOOCs are recommended by considering the needs of the learners, course content design, and strategies encouraging the enrolled students to enter the courses. © 2020, Athabasca University.","Massive open online courses; MITx; MOOCs; Online learning",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Adair, D., Alman, S.W., Budzick, D., Grisham, L.M., Mancini, M.E., Thackaberry, A.S., Many shades of MOOCs (2014) Internet Learning, 3 (1), pp. 53-72; Aparicio, M., Oliveira, T., Bacao, F., Painho, M., Gamification: A key determinant of massive open online course (MOOC) success (2019) Information & Management, 56 (1), pp. 39-54; Barak, M., Watted, A., Haick, H., Motivation to learn in massive open online courses: Examining aspects of language and social engagement (2016) Computers & Education, 94, pp. 49-60; Bayeck, R., Exploratory study of MOOC learners' demographics and motivation: The case of students involved in groups (2016) Open Praxis, 8 (3), pp. 223-233; Beaven, T., Codreanu, T., Creuzé, A., Motivation in a language MOOC: Issues for course designers (2014) Language MOOCs: Providing learning, transcending boundaries, pp. 48-66. , M.

Existing badge frameworks offer conceptual design guidelines, but does not provide granular support to the visual badge design process. This paper reports on a work-in-progress case study which aim to design badges targeted MOOCs for the creative industry.

We report on two case studies where cohorts of learners were offered coupons for free certificates to explore how price reductions might influence behavior in MOOC-based online learning settings. In Case Study 1,we compare participation and certification rates between courses with and without free-certificate coupons. In the courses with a free-certificate track, participants signed up for the verified-certificate track at higher rates, and completion rates among verified students were higher than in the paid-certificate track courses. In Case Study 2, we compare learner behavior within the same courses by whether they received access to a free-certificate track. Access to free certificates was associated with lower certification rates, but overall, certification rates remained high, particularly among those who viewed the courses. These findings suggest that some incentives, other than simply the cost of paying for a verified-certificate track, may motivate learners to complete MOOCs. © 2019 Athabasca University.","Distance learning; Free coupons; Learning analytics; Massive open online courses; MOOCs; Online learning; Price elasticity",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Armstrong, L., (2014) Barriers to innovation and change in higher education, , https://www.tiaainstitute.org/publication/barriers-innovation-and-change; Baker, R., Passmore, D., Value and pricing of MOOCs (2016) Education Sciences, 6 (2), p. 14. , https://doi.org/10.3390/educsci6020014; Blazar, D., Validating teacher effects on students' attitudes and behaviors: Evidence from random assignment of teachers to students (2018) Education Finance and Policy, 13 (3), pp. 281-309. , https://doi.org/10.1162/edfp_a_00251; Bonvillian, W., Singer, S., The online challenge to higher education (2013) Issues in Science and Technology, 29 (4). , https://issues.org/the-online-challenge-to-higher-education/; Bryan, G.A., Whipple, T.W., Tuition elasticity of the demand for higher education among current students: A pricing model (1995) The Journal of Higher Education, 66 (5), pp. 560-574. , https://doi.org/10.2307/2943936; Campbell, J., Gibbs, A.L., Najafi, H., Severinski, C., A comparison of learner intent and behaviour in live and archived MOOCs (2014) The International Review of Research in Open and Distributed Learning, 15 (5). , https://doi.org/10.19173/irrodl.v15i5.1854; Chuang, I., Ho, A., HarvardX and MITx: Four years of open online courses-Fall 2012-Summer 2016 (2016) SSRN, , https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2889436; Cohodes, S.R., Goodman, J.S., Merit aid, college quality, and college completion: Massachusetts' Adams Scholarship as an in-kind subsidy (2014) American Economic Journal: Applied Economics, 6 (4), pp. 251-285. , https://doi.org/10.1257/app.6.4.251; Dellarocas, C., Van Alstyne, M., Money models for MOOCs (2013) Communications of the ACM, 56 (8), pp. 25-28. , https://doi.org/10.1145/2492007.2492017; Dynarski, S.M., (2001) Does aid matter?

Additionally, new modes of adaptive learning need to be designed to develop innovative training programs. Many authors agree that “innovation in pedagogy concerns everything that is not part of formal education” (Lison et al. 2014). In 2016, the Ministry of National Education, Vocational Training, Higher Education and Scientific Research in collaboration with GIP FUN MOOC, and the French Embassy signed an agreement to establish a platform MUN “Morocco Digital University”. The purpose of the agreement is to encourage Moroccan Universities to develop Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), Small Private Online Courses (SPOCs), and other forms of online courses and to reinforce partnership with French Universities in e-learning. MOOCs were developed in 2008, and after four years of operation, the New York Times considered 2012 “The year of the MOOC”. Since then, new features of MOOCs have motivated decision makers in higher education from across the world to create a number of online courses in their institutions. However, the weakness of MOOCs as a pedagogical innovation is the high dropout rate. Despite being massive courses, of thousands of enrollees, 50% quit after one week, 10% finish the course after completing all the modules, and only 4% obtain a certificate (Perna et al, Life Cycle of a Million MOOC Users. MOOC Research Initiative.Arlington, Texas, 2013). Given MOOCs are large-scale learning platforms that have failed to meet learners’ individual needs, considering this innovative pedagogy effective enough is conditional on adapting instruction to enhance student learning, learner’s characteristics, for example, knowledge or personal interests. In fact, why not implement adaptive learning techniques to further customize MOOCs? The purpose of this study is twofold. First, it aims to uncover the feasibility of adaptive learning on MOOCs in higher education in Morocco. Second, this investigation seeks to address the effects of adaptive learning on student learning outcomes, student engagement, and drop-out rates. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Abandon; Adaptive MOOC; E-learning; Higher education; MOOC","Curricula; Decision making; Intelligent systems; Learning systems; Life cycle; Planning; Students; Sustainable development; Technology transfer; Abandon; Adaptive MOOC; Higher education; Large-scale learning; Massive open online course; MOOC; Scientific researches; Student learning outcomes; E-learning",,,,,,,,,,,,"Poumay, M., L’innovation pédagogique dans le contexte de l’enseignement supérieur (2014) La pédagogie Universitaire à l’heure Du numérique-Questionnement Et éclairages De La Recherche, , Lameul, G., Loisy, C (eds.), De Boeck, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgique; May, P., Ehrlich, H.-C., Steinke, T., ZIB structure prediction pipeline: Composing a complex biological workflow through web services (2006) Euro-Par 2006, 4128, pp. 1148-1158. , https://doi.org/10.1007/11823285_121, Nagel, W.E., Walter, W.V., Lehner, W.

Provided that effort is closely linked to time, previous research has found a positive relationship between student effort over time and student success, both in university education and Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). With the complex environment of tracing and identifying relevant data of student learning processes in MOOCs, this study employs learning analytics to examine this relationship for MITx 6.00x, an introductory programming and computer science MOOC hosted on the edX MOOC platform. A population sample from the MOOC (N = 32,621) was examined using logistic regression, controlling for variables that may also influence the outcome. Conversely, the outcome of this research study suggests that there is a curvilinear relationship between effort over time and student success, meaning those who exert effort for the longest amount of time in the MOOC actually have a lower probability of obtaining a certificate than others who exert effort over somewhat less time. Finally, research implications are discussed. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Efforts; Learning analytics; Logistic regression; Massive open online course (MOOC); Study success; Total time","Computer programming; E-learning; Regression analysis; Efforts; Learning analytics; Logistic regressions; Massive open online course; Study success; Total time; Students",,,,,,,,,,,,"Baker, R.S., Inventado, P.S., Educational data mining and learning analytics (2014) Learning Analytics: From Research to Practice, pp. 61-75. , Springer, New York; Bowman, N.A., Hill, P.L., Denson, N., Bronkema, R., Keep on truckin’or stay the course?

This study aims to present the findings of a study among veterinary science students examining their perceptions of MOOCs. In total, 200 participants were randomly selected for the survey, out of which 177 responded, owing to a response rate of 88.7 per cent. Majority of the respondents (93 per cent) opined MOOCs supplement other learning methods and provide lifelong opportunity. A study report established that Coursera is the largest platform by user base (82 per cent), followed by Udemy (70 per cent), and 65 per cent knowledge seekers ranted the enormous propaganda about MOOCs are not because of the technology’s inherent edifying value, but because of the incredible potentials of lower costs. The participants in this survey valued their course and overall MOOC experience pleasing. Design/methodology/approach: The aim of the study is to explore veterinary students’ perception of MOOCs featuring in their subject of interest. The questionnaire was written in English because it is the teaching language for undergraduates and postgraduates in most Indian higher education institutes, including the one used as a context for this study. The online questionnaires were electronically mailed to a sample of veterinary students (undergraduate and postgraduate) with a consent form seeking their permission for participation in this study and swearing them the confidentiality of their responses. The e-mail included information about the purpose of the study as well as the URL to the survey site, demographic questions on age, gender and education. This part was followed by an important research question asking if the student had heard about the new open online educational system (MOOCs) provided in websites, including Coursera, Edx, Udacity and FutureLearn, among others. Based on respondents’ answers, they were directed to different sections. Students who knew about MOOCs were asked various mode of getting enrolled in MOOCs. If they were not enrolled in any course, the respondents were asked about the limitations to their use. Enrolled students were questioned on their perspectives and experiences with MOOCs. For students who gained certificates, were enquired for their level of satisfaction, opinions about the integration of MOOCs into the veterinary field and hindrances encountered during accessing the course. Out of a total of 200 students who initially agreed to take part, 177 responses were received, with a response rate of 88.50 per cent, with no cases of missing data. The data were stored automatically in the hosted online survey service into a separate database after the submission of the responses. The descriptive data analyses (such as average) were led using the data analysis tool provided. Findings: Even though most MOOCs do not provide academic credit or result in a degree, some of the biggest beneficiaries of MOOCs are students formally enrolled in an academic program, are provided a free mode to obtain additional academic assistance that would not otherwise be available (Parke Muth, 2018)15. Correspondingly, 93 per cent of the students opined MOOCs supplement other learning methods and provide lifelong opportunity. Learning has traditionally cost both money and time. With MOOCs, it now just costs time. In total, 24 per cent of the participants have discoursed free of cost as one of the intentions to choose their course. Almost every respondent (99 per cent) was interested toward online discussion forum, and 91 per cent preferred course materials containing video and audio files were pretty beneficial, while 88 per cent felt teaching through electronic whiteboard was the most advantageous criterion in their course. The study findings indicated that Coursera is the largest platform by user base (82 per cent), followed by Udemy (70 per cent). Research limitations/implications: The study considered veterinary science undergraduate (BVSc) and postgraduate (MVSc) students alone, veterinary faculties are not included for the survey. There was comparatively less participation of respondents who enrolled or successfully completed a MOOC, which makes the analysis of limitations and satisfaction less reliable. Hence, the study results cannot be generalized as a comprehensive report of veterinary science scholars’ perceptiveness. Originality/value: Animal health involves household pets and their care, in addition to livestock health and protection from diseases like bovine babesiosis, bovine tuberculosis and heartwater. There are numerous MOOCs offering online, contact or blended interventions in veterinary science and animal health that afford professionals quick and easy options to obtain credentials, including courses in pharmacology and toxicology, practice management, veterinary and para-veterinary studies, veterinary tropical diseases, radiology and wildlife management. As it is necessary to gain an understanding of the veterinary students’ level of familiarity and their insight toward the MOOC concept, the study attempts to explore their knowledge through an online survey. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Information dissemination; Knowledge seekers; Learning; MOOCs; Online; Veterinary science",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Aboshady, O., Radwan, A., Eltaweel, A., Perception and use of massive open online courses among medical students in a developing country: multicenter cross-sectional study (2015) BMJ Open, 5 (1), pp. 1-9; Admiraal, W., Huisman, B., Pilli, O., Assessment in massive open online courses (2015) Electronic Journal of eLearning, 13 (4), pp. 207-216; Aharony, N., Bar-Ilan, J., Students’ perceptions on MOOCs: an exploratory study (2016) Interdisciplinary Journal of e-Skills and Lifelong Learning, 12, pp. 145-162; Ayub, E., Wei, G.W., Yue, W.S., Exploring factors affecting learners' acceptance of MOOCs based on Kirkpatrick's model (2017) ACM Digital Library, pp. 34-39; Braun, A., (2018) 4 of the best MOOC platforms for online learning and getting a degree, , www.maketecheasier.com/best-mooc-platforms-online-learning/, (accessed: 12 September 2019; Carey, K., (2012) Into the future with MOOCs, , www.chronicle.com/article/Into-the-Future-With-MOOCs/134080, (accessed: 12 September 2019; Carson, S., Schmidt, J.P., (2012) The massive open online professor, , www.academicmatters.ca/2012/05/the-massive-open-online-professor/, (accessed: 12 September 2019; Cole, A.W., Timmerman, C.E., What do current college students think about MOOCs?

Online educational pattern, both inside and outside of the campus community, have been become more popular. In recent years, a new research agenda has emerged, focusing on predicting and explaining dropouts and MOOCs with low completion rates. However, due to different problem specifications and evaluation metrics, performing learning analytics (LA) of online education is a challenging task. The online learner has a variety of purposes, such as complete learning courses, some knowledge points in work-based learning courses, selective learning for reviewing exams, certificate-based learning, and watching videos for interest. According to users'online behavior data, it is difficult to study why so many people drop out of MOOCs. Because users have many reasons, such as not understanding, bad network connection, other things to do, and so on. This paper study was performed to analyze data of students' online activity in a blended computer education course in Northwestern Polytechnical University (NPU) to identify quantitative markers that correlate with students' performance and might be used as early warning signs for possible data-driven measures. We applied the research methodology to three online courses offered generously by the Chinese University MOOC (CUMOOC) to evaluate the effectiveness. © 2019 ACM.","Learning Analytics; Learning Management System; MOOC; Prediction","Artificial intelligence; Behavioral research; Curricula; Mobile telecommunication systems; Students; Chinese universities; Early warning signs; Massive open online course; Network connection; Problem specification; Research methodologies; Selective learning; Work-Based Learning; E-learning",,,,,,,,,,,,"Miguel Ángel, C., Hernández-García, Á., Learning analytics for educational decision making (2015) Computers in Human Behavior, 47, pp. 1-3; Beth, D., Carmean, C., Wagner, E.D., (2009) The Evolution of the LMS: From Management to Learning, , Santa Rosa, CA: e-Learning Guild; Joseph, S., (2017) Programmer Competency Matrix, , https://sijinjoseph.com/programmer-competency-matrix/, Sijin Joseph [Accessed: 11-May-2017]; Kotsiantis Sotiris, B., Pierrakeas, C.J., Pintelas, P.E., Preventing student dropout in distance learning using machine learning techniques (2003) International Conference on Knowledge-based and Intelligent Information and Engineering Systems, , Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg; Yair, L., Comparing dropouts and persistence in e-learning courses (2007) Computers & Education, 48 (2), pp. 185-204; Leslie, B., Spennemann, D.H., Patterns of user behaviour in university online forums (2004) International Journal of Instructional Technology and Distance Learning, 1 (10), pp. 11-28; David, M., Using data mining for e-learning decision making (2005) Electronic Journal of E-Learning, 3 (1), pp. 41-54; Nicolae, N., Neubauer, K., From participation to dropout: Quantitative participation patterns in online university courses (2010) Computers & Education, 55 (2), pp. 663-672; Diyi, Y., Turn on, tune in, drop out: Anticipating student dropouts in massive open online courses (2013) Proceedings of the 2013 NIPS Data-driven Education Workshop, 11; Arti, R., Modeling learner engagement in MOOCs using probabilistic soft logic (2013) NIPS Workshop on Data Driven Education, 21; Onah Daniel, F.O., Sinclair, J., Boyatt, R., Dropout rates of massive open online courses: Behavioural patterns (2014) EDULEARN14 Proceedings, 1, pp. 5825-5834; Sherif, H., Greene, D., Mitchell, J., Dropout prediction in MOOCs using learner activity features (2014) Proceedings of the Second European MOOC Stakeholder Summit, 37 (1), pp. 58-65; Ioanna, L., Dropout prediction in e-learning courses through the combination of machine learning techniques (2009) Computers & Education, 53 (3), pp. 950-965; Dursun, D., A comparative analysis of machine learning techniques for student retention management (2010) Decision Support Systems, 49 (4), pp. 498-506; Girish, B., Coetzee, D., Predicting student retention in massive open online courses using hidden markov models (2013) Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, 53, pp. 57-58. , University of California at Berkeley; Mi, F., Yeung, D., Temporal models for predicting student dropout in massive open online courses (2015) 2015 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshop (ICDMW), , IEEE; Karen, S., Zisserman, A., (2014) Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-scale Image Recognition, , arXiv preprint arXiv 1409.1556; Jacob, W., (2015) Beyond Prediction: First Steps Toward Automatic Intervention in MOOC Student Stopout, , SSRN 2611750; Alex, G., Mohamed, A., Hinton, G., Speech recognition with deep recurrent neural networks (2013) 2013 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing.

The research was conducted in a cohort-based astronomy MOOC ""Astronomy: Exploring Time and Space"" provided through the Coursera platform. In order to discern motivations of course participants, the Science Motivation Questionnaire II was administered as a first assignment of the course. The survey data were collected from December 2016 until December 2018 and responses from 3701 learners were acquired. In order to determine the relationship of motivation to course performance, four course engagement indicators are defined: course completion, use of video lectures, participation in the discussion forums, and participation in peer-grading assignments. Self-determination and self-efficacy are identified as the main motivational factors influencing all aspects of the course engagement except for the video usage. We show that both of these decrease with age, but increase with the number of previously taken science courses. The main reasons for signing up for the course which had an effect on course engagement were the goal of getting a certificate and perceived importance of the reputation of the instructor. There was no statistically significant difference in motivations between people who dropped after the first peer graded writing assignment and those who successfully completed the course, suggesting that after the first writing assignment learners quit from other reasons than lack of motivation. Unexpectedly, learners with high career, grade, and social motivation watched statistically significantly fewer instructional videos, and social motivation did not play a role in the forum usage. © 2019 authors.

This paper aims to give tutors a clearer vision for an effective and personalized intervention as a solution to “retain” each type of learner at risk of dropping out. Design/methodology/approach: This paper presents a methodology to provide predictions on learners’ behaviors. This work, which uses a Stanford data set, was divided into several phases, namely, a data extraction, an exploratory study and then a multivariate analysis to reduce dimensionality and to extract the most relevant features. The second step was the comparison between five machine learning algorithms. Finally, the authors used the principle of association rules to extract similarities between the behaviors of learners who dropped out from the MOOC. Findings: The results of this work have given that deep learning ensures the best predictions in terms of accuracy, which is an average of 95.8 per cent, and is comparable to other measures such as precision, AUC, Recall and F1 score. Originality/value: Many research studies have tried to tackle the MOOC dropout problem by proposing different dropout predictive models. In the same context, comes the present proposal with which the authors have tried to predict not only learners at a risk of dropping out of the MOOCs but also those who will succeed or fail. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Association rules; Machine learning; MOOC","Association rules; Deep learning; Distance education; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Multivariant analysis; Predictive analytics; Design/methodology/approach; Exploratory studies; Massive open online course; MOOC; Multi variate analysis; Predictive models; Relevant features; Research studies; Learning systems",,,,,,"This research was done through Stanford University?s Center for Advanced Research through Online Learning (CAROL); the authors are thankful for all the facilities provided.

We often hear about the high dropout rates in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). On the other hand, there is a lot of movement towards micro-credentials, online master's degrees based on MOOCs, and formal MOOC degrees. However, what is the classic MOOC clientele actually doing with their certificates? What are the reasons why successful MOOC learners put a lot of time and effort in exams and exercises? Do employers accept these certificates in application portfolios? Do they allow their employees to participate in a MOOC during their working hours? Do they pay for the certificates? Are there any differences concerning gender because women are still in the minority in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) and their career paths often hit a plateau? These questions have been on our mind since we started offering courses on our MOOC platform in 2012. We have had anecdotal evidence, for example, that a participant was helped to get a new job with a certificate from one of our courses - yet this is ultimately just hearsay. Therefore, to find out what is really going on we conducted a survey among the 187,000 registered users of our platform. © 2019 IEEE.","Certificates; Gender; Micro-credentials; MOOC; STEM; Survey","Professional aspects; STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics); Surveying; Anecdotal evidences; Certificates; Gender; Massive open online course; Master's degree; Micro-credentials; MOOC; Science , Technology , Engineering and Mathematics; Surveys",,,,,,,,,,,,"OpenHPI, , https://open.hpi.de/, (last access on March, 24 2019); https://hpi.de/en/school-of-design-thinking/design-thinking.html, School of Design Thinking Hasso Plattner Institute, Thinking new, working differently.

To better understand the impact of grades, we observe overall student activity on two MITx MOOCs for certified students and students who continuously participate in MOOC assignments. We use click stream data to compile the overall activity of a student and we use points earned divided by total possible points to calculate the students' grades. We observe that students with the highest levels of activity have some of the highest grades. We also observe that the difference in activity before and after the finalization of a grade (delta-Activity) have greater variation as grade increases. Finally, we observe very little changes in grades (delta-grade) for certified students when visualized against delta-Activity and that continuously participating students have greater grade changes compared to certified students. © 2019 IEEE.","data analysis; feedback; grades; MOOCs; student behavior","Data reduction; Feedback; Grading; Comprehensive exams; Continued participations; Course material; Learning behavior; Massive open online course; MOOCs; Student behavior; Students' grades; Students",,,,,,,,,,,,"Breslow, L., Pritchard, D.E., DeBoer, J., Stump, G.S., Ho, A.D., Seaton, D.T., Studying learning in the worldwide classroom research into edxs first mooc (2013) Research & Practice in Assessment, 8, pp. 13-25; Butler, D.L., Winne, P.H., Feedback and self-regulated learning: A theoretical synthesis (1995) Review of Educational Research, 65 (3), pp. 245-281; Carver, C., Scheier, M., Origins and functions of positive and negative affect: A control-process view (1990) Psychological Review, 97 (1), pp. 19-35; Magill, R., The influence of augmented feedback on skill learning depends on characteristics of the skill and the learner (1994) Quest, 46 (8), pp. 314-327; Main, J.B., Ost, B., The impact of letter grades on student effort, course selection, and major choice: A regression-discontinuity analysis (2014) The Journal of Economic Education, 45 (1), pp. 1-10; Ren, Z., Rangwala, H., Johri, A., Predicting performance on MOOC assessments using multi-regression models (2016) CoRR, Vol. Abs/1605.02269, , http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.02269; Halawa, S., Greene, D., Mitchell, J., Dropout prediction in moocs using learner activity features (2014) Proceedings of the Second European MOOC Stakeholder Summit, 37 (1), pp. 7-16",,,"Class Central;edX;et al.;Future Learn;IBL News;IEEE","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","2019 IEEE Learning With MOOCS, LWMOOCS 2019","23 October 2019 through 25 October 2019",,156270,,9781728125497,,,"English","Proc.

Their value can be quantified by the 'doer effect'-A reliable correlation between practice and learning outcomes that is stronger than the correlation between video watching and learning outcomes. In two computational thinking and programming MOOCs, we first confirm the doer effect for all certificate earners in short and long term grade outcomes. This leads to asking: Is the doer effect similar when experienced learners are compared to novices? Is it present, regardless of the topic being taught? We find the doer effect varies in magnitude across learners of different experience level and topics, suggesting that the importance of practice depends on the topic and the learner's background. Our findings inform scalable instructional design in MOOCs by demonstrating that the doer effect, present at a high level, also exhibits fine-grained variation across student background and topics. © 2019 IEEE.","computational thinking; doer effect; learning by doing; Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs)","Curricula; Computational thinkings; doer effect; Fundamental design; Instructional designs; Interactive practice; Learning by doing; Learning outcome; Massive open online course; E-learning",,,,,,,,,,,,"Breslow, L., Pritchard, D.E., DeBoer, J., Stump, G.S., Ho, A.D., Seaton, D.T., Studying learning in the worldwide classroom: Research into edxs first mooc (2013) Research & Practice in Assessment, 8; Gardner, J., Brooks, C., Student success prediction in moocs User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction, 28 (2), pp. 127-203. , Jun 2018; Wing, J.M., Computational thinking (2006) Commun ACM, 49 (3), pp. 33-35. , Mar; Koedinger, K.R., McLaughlin, E.A., Jia, J.Z., Bier, N.L., Is the doer effect a causal relationship?: How can we tell and why its important (2016) LAK, 2016, pp. 388-397. , ACM; Koedinger, K.R., Kim, J., Jia, J.Z., McLaughlin, E.A., Bier, N.L., Learning is not a spectator sport: Doing is better than watching for learning from a mooc (2015) L@S, pp. 111-120. , ACM 2015; Koedinger, K.R., Scheines, R., Schaldenbrand, P., Is the doer effect robust across multiple data sets?

The aim of this study was to investigate learners' behaviours and correlate patterns of Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) with performance and achievement during a MOOC in Implant Dentistry. Methods: The clickstream data of learners from the first run of the MOOC Implant dentistry by The University of Hong Kong were modelled and quantified based on Zimmerman's SRL model. The data were quantitatively analysed by means of k-means clustering for evidence of five SRL behavioural indicators of student activity. The clusters identified were then correlated with student engagement and learning performance. Results: A total of 7608 individuals enrolled, 5014 engaged (active learners 65.90%), 1277 of them (25.47%) completed the course and 1232 purchased a certificate. Two major groups of learners emerged: Attentive (n = 1433) who were more likely to follow the prescribed pathway in the MOOC and Auditors (n = 3581) who accessed content selectively. There was significantly higher engagement, achievement and completion rates among Attentive than Auditors. Both groups included subcategories (Browser, Digger, Test-driven, Sampler, Persistent) which might reflect different SRL strategies. Conclusion: A MOOC in a clinical discipline can achieve high enrolment and completion rates as compared to current benchmarks. There appears to be a wide diversity of learning behaviours among learners, with two however dominant patterns. Learners with a linear learning pathway achieved significantly higher grades and completion rates than those who accessed content irregularly and selectively. Such differences however might be influenced by the demographic and professional background of the learner, as well as their motivation to attending the MOOC. Certain learning behaviours, in particular how learners access content in relation to assessments might be closer related to SRL. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

We report on two case studies where cohorts of learners were offered coupons for free-certificates to explore price reductions might influence user behavior in MOOC-based online learning settings. In Case Study #1, we compare participation and certification rates between courses with and without coupons for free-certificates. In the courses with a free-certificate track, participants signed up for the verified certificate track at higher rates and completion rates among verified students were higher than in the paid-certificate track courses. In Case Study #2, we compare the behaviors of learners within the same courses based on whether they received access to a free-certificate track. Access to free-certificates was associated with somewhat lower certification rates, but overall certification rates remained high particularly among those who viewed the courses. These findings suggests that some other incentives, other than simply the sunk-cost of paying for a verified certificate-track, may motivate learners to complete MOOC courses. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

The intentions to enroll for a specific course vary significantly and depend on one’s professional or personal learning needs and interests. All learners have in common that they pursue their individual learning objectives. However, predominant MOOC platforms follow a one-size-fits-all approach and primarily aim for completion with certification. Specifically, technical support for goal-oriented and self-regulated learning to date is very limited in this context although both learning strategies are proven to be key factors for students’ achievement in large-scale online learning environments. In this first investigation, a concept for the application and technical integration of personalized learning objectives in a MOOC platform is realized and assessed. It is evaluated with a mixed-method approach. First, the learners’ acceptance is examined with a multivariate A/B test in two courses. Second, a survey was conducted to gather further feedback about the perceived usefulness, next to the acceptance. The results show a positive perception by the learners, which paves the way for future research. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

To better understand how student behavior is influenced by grade feedback, we conduct a study on the changes of certified students’ behavior before and after they have received their grade. We use observational student data from two MITx MOOCs to examine student behavior before and after a grade is released and calculate the difference (the delta-activity). We then analyze the changes in the delta-activity distributions across all graded assignments a we observe that the variation in delta-activity decreases as grade decreases, with students who have the lowest grade exhibiting little or no change in weekly activity. This trend persists throughout each course, in all course offerings, suggesting that a change in grade does not correlate with a change in the behavior of certified MOOC students.

Through web platforms, universities and other institutions offer content and courses where any student can enroll. With this new approach, much knowledge that previously was only accessible to official students paying, in general, expensive fees, is now accessible to any citizen for free. In addition, institutions of higher education usually grant a certificate to students who passed the course. However, this divulgative and massive open approach also creates some distortions. In particular, the management of MOOC courses is a task of extreme complexity, due to the mixture of a large number of very different student profiles, and the combination of nonaligned interests. As a consequence, the dropout rate in these courses is higher than 70% in most courses. In any case, before proposing any solution, it is necessary to analyze and study the current situation in a systematic and scientific way. Therefore, this article describes an experience carried out jointly by professors from the Universidad Politécnica de Madrid (UPM, Spain) and the University of Tras os Montes e Alto Douro (Portugal), based on the creation and teaching of a MOOC course focused on domotics and Arduino technologies, accessible on the MiriadaX platform.

Here, we present a new online database of policy documents related to ES: GlobaLDES (https://tinyurl.com/GlobalDES). The database was created in 2016 and compiled through a crowdsourced process. Learners involved in a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) were invited to submit documents that explicitly refer to ES. We included in our analysis documents related to laws, regulations, ordonnances, tax incentives, certification, and strategic planning. By early 2018 the database contained 136 relevant entries from 46 countries. Most examples (60%) were in a language other than English. More than 50% of entries addressed multiple ES or the link between biodiversity and ES. There was also a positive temporal trend towards inclusion of multiple ecosystem services. The GlobaLDES database represents the first known snapshot of the mainstreaming of the ES concept at a global scale. Our analysis suggests an accelerating adoption of the ES concept into policy. As the number of entries improves, GlobaLDES will serve as a useful benchmarking tool for monitoring the diffusion of the ES concept into policy-making. © 2019","Citizen science; Ecosystem services; Environmental mainstreaming; GlobaLDES; Massive Open Online Course",,,,,,"MAVA Foundation; Umeå Universitet; Université de Genève, UNIGE","The authors thank the participants of the MOOC ‘Ecosystem Services: a Method for Sustainable Development’ who helped complete the GlobalDES database.

This study applied self-organizing map and hierarchical clustering algorithms to the log files of a physics MOOC capturing how students solved weekly homework and quiz problems to identify clusters of students showing similar problem-solving patterns. The usefulness of the identified clusters was verified by examining various characteristics of students such as number of problems students attempted to solve, weekly and daily problem completion percentages, and whether they earned a course certificate.

This initiative targeted flexible learners, defined as adults engaged in part-time or online distance learning, during the initial stages of the study life-cycle. Drawing on the literature, the experiences of major international Online and Distance Learning (ODL) providers, and a set of overarching design principles, the MOOC (Massive open online course) was developed with a suite of digital readiness tools at its heart. These tools were combined with other supporting materials in order to deliver a comprehensive pre-entry socialisation course. A small pilot of Head Start Online ran over five weeks with 150 people enrolled and 50 going on to receive a certificate of completion. The feedback received, albeit limited by the numbers of respondents, indicates that a course that strategically uses digital readiness tools can have a positive impact on new and prospective flexible learners. © 2019, QUT Library.

This project produced a suite of digital readiness tools, as Open Educational Resources (OERs), for the higher education sector. Head Start Online harnessed these tools to create a cohesive resource for new/prospective learners. The MOOC is designed to assist flexible learners in the early stages of the study lifecycle many students who withdraw do not return (Woodley & Simpson, 2014), this emphasises the importance of targeted support in the early stages of the study lifecycle, when students are thinking about study, making decisions, and preparing themselves (Anagnostopoulou & Parmer, 2008; Shillington et al. 2012; Stone, 2012).

To do this, a process mining process discovery technique so-called Fuzzy Miner, based on Frequency-Based and Time-Performance metrics, was applied on a set of event logs previously collected from an authentic learning environment. The resulting fuzzy graphs/models showed a significant dissimilarity between the two groups in terms of the behavioral structure and the sequence of the performed/executed tasks (and activities), the average (mean) duration of the waiting times (or inactive interval/time gaps) in addition to the emotional mood shifts and changes. The findings of the study can be beneficial to not only the MOOC course developers, but to lecturers and researchers as well, in such a way leading to higher attrition rate running online courses and syllabuses. © 2018 IEEE.","Emotion Analytics; Fuzzy Graphs; Fuzzy Miner Algorithm; Massive Open Online Course; MOOC; Process Mining; Time Performance","Computer aided instruction; Data mining; Fuzzy sets; Fuzzy systems; Graph theory; Knowledge engineering; Miners; Emotion Analytics; Fuzzy graph; Massive open online course; MOOC; Process mining; Time Performance; E-learning",,,,,,,,,,,,"(2013) MOOCs on the Move: How Coursera Is Disrupting the Traditional Classroom, , (text and video).

Industry leaders can benefit from these courses because they foster the professional development of their employees in their industry. Despite these benefits, these online courses continue to register a high dropout rate and a vast number of their learners do not acquire the certificate provided at the completion of the course. This article proposes a predictive modeling tool with several Machine Learning algorithms (for generating Predictive Models) and feature engineering in MOOCs data integrated to contribute research to this specific issue. The proposed tool predicts two situations: which learners are likely to leave the course (dropout) and which learners are expected to pass the course (certificate acquisition). The tool was tested in fifteen deliveries of seven MOOCs. Initial results provide interesting information, for instance, that the accuracy of predicting certificate acquisition is higher than the precision of predicting dropout for all algorithms. © 2018 IEEE.","Educational Data Mining; learning Analytics; lifelong Learning; machine Learning; MOOC; professional Learning","Curricula; Data mining; Engineering education; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Machine learning; Predictive analytics; Professional aspects; Educational data mining; learning Analytics; Life long learning; MOOC; Professional learning; E-learning",,,,,"S2013/ICE-2715; TIN2014-52129-R","This work has been founded by the R&D program of Madrid (S2013/ICE-2715) and the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness project Flexor (TIN2014-52129-R).",,,,,,"Milligan, C., Littlejohn, A., Supporting professional learning in a massive open online course (2014) The International Review of Research in Open and Distributed Learning, [S.l.], 15 (5). , Oct.

Indeed, what was but a few decades ago exclusively reserved for classroom attendees of university institutions and their closed intranets has today become a publicly accessible source of information, with public and private-owned eLearning MOOC (Massive Open Online Courses) platforms dominating the digital landscape and bringing with them a plethora of services such as video courses, certifications and employee recruitment. Nonetheless, while adding significant public value, such platforms still fail to completely bridge the gap between academia and industry in the hands-on knowledge application sense. This is especially true for domains such as machine learning that are known to require tremendous computational resources if one wishes to transition from simplistic lab exercises to complex state-of-the-art models, which is something a MOOC - or most academic institutions for that matter - simply cannot afford. Private cloud providers have taken up the challenge here and opened their offerings to the research community with programs such as TensorFlow Research Cloud, Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK) on Azure, Apache MXNet on Amazon AWS, to name but a few. Nonetheless, access to such resources remains limited: either the resources themselves are scarce and consequently freely available only to a restricted research community, or they are free for a limited time, or they follow a freemium model. This paper describes a novel distributed publicly-hosted overlay network that provides free collaborative eLearning material and computational resources to its users. Unlike most of its P2P counterparts in existence today that address alternative public needs (i.e. anonymity, file sharing,…), it offers unlimited runtime access to all the computational resources that collectively define its topology. In this respect, an example use case is one wherein a distributed machine learning system can be orchestrated by any user and freely deployed for execution on any number of available nodes within the network, without any limitation other than that of the underlying hardware and network latency performance capabilities themselves. Additionally, source code and accompanying eLearning courses are regularly published to the network and made freely available by users belonging to the academic and subject matter expert practitioner community, implementing solutions ranging from simple classroom exercises to entire production-ready systems. The network is collaborative by design, such that learning material can be collectively worked on and published, training data can be shared and successfully deployed software solutions can be load-balanced and made accessible to the entire community. Moreover, the distributed network follows a decentralized model governed only by a handful of master nodes that, similarly to all its other nodes, are hosted by the users themselves, and in this sense constitutes a novel cloud offering maintained by the general public rather than any given private cloud provider. Finally, we argue that beyond its educational and computational power offerings, the described network likely constitutes the best test platform for any designed software system: indeed, given the volatile nature of the network (wherein user-hosted resources can join or go offline at any moment), we claim that any software system that can “survive” and maintain its levels of SLA (service level agreement) on this network is guaranteed to perform similarly or better on a more traditional pay-per-usage cloud provider infrastructure. © 2019, National Defence University - Carol I Printing House.

MOOCs are online courses that are open to everyone and anyone to join with typically no limits to the number of participants or prerequisite qualifications. In some MOOCs there is an option to pay for a certificate upon completion. This chapter captures the use and future of MOOCs in the biomedical sciences. As the number of MOOCs available in biomedical subject areas grow, so do the number of participants taking these courses, with many of these learners and professionals looking to update their knowledge in the biomedical sciences. There is also a growing use of MOOCs in higher education as a recourse for campus degree programmes, known as hybrid MOOCs, where the MOOC provides the learning and the assessment is undertaken by the educational institution. The growing number of MOOCs available for credit is changing the way some learners are accessing higher education and the development of micro degrees obtained through the completion of a number of MOOCs may potentially change the way higher education is provided in the future. Finally, the potential of artificial intelligence to provide virtual classroom assistants is also a possible game changer, allowing more personalised learning to be delivered at scale. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Biomedical; Open online courses (MOOC)","adult; artificial intelligence; education; female; human; human experiment; learning; male; education; educational technology; Internet; Education, Distance; Educational Technology; Internet; Learning",,,,,,,,,,,,"Adam, M, Young-Wolff, KC, Konar, E, Winkleby, M, Massive open online nutrition and cooking course for improved eating behaviours and meal composition (2015) Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act, 12, pp. 143-152; Adampoulos, P, What makes a great MOOC?

Massive open online course (MOOC) platforms such as Coursera, edX, and Udemy have made available several thousands of short courses at several difficulty levels in a wide variety of disciplines, ranging from business, computer science to literature, for learners to select from. Learners who are looking to earn credentials for career advancement or personal interest would find MOOCs attractive not only because of the time and place flexibility these courses offer, but also because of the free enrollment or the very small certificate fee upon completion, as well as the emergent recognition these courses are receiving for their high quality learning delivery from leading educational institutions. Learners who enroll in a MOOC would typically need to participate in various learning activities and complete a few assessment tasks to complete the course. However, it has been commonly reported that the completion rates of MOOCs are low. Based on the common notion that when learners are more motivated to learn, they are likely to better engage in learning and have a higher likelihood to complete a MOOC, this study adopted the Motivation and Engagement Scale (MES) by Martin (2007, 2009) to collect responses from university students to examine whether positive motivation resulted in positive engagement; whether negative motivation resulted in negative engagement; and how positive or negative engagement swayed learners’ inclination to complete a MOOC if they were to enroll in one. Findings show that there was a statistically significant positive relationship between positive motivation and positive engagement, between negative motivation and negative engagement, and between positive engagement and inclination to complete a MOOC. However, the relationship between negative engagement and inclination to complete a MOOC was statistically not significant. Findings of this study can be useful to MOOC providers and learners in their effort to develop strategies to increase completion rates of MOOCs. ©ACPIL","Inclination to complete; Learning engagement; Learning motivation; Massive open online course; Online learning",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Alario-Hoyos, C., Estévez-Ayres, I., Pérez-Sanagustín, M., Delgado Kloos, C., Fernández-Panadero, C., Understanding learners’ motivation and learning strategies in MOOCs (2017) International Review of Research in Open and Distributed Learning, 18 (3), pp. 119-137; Alraimi, K.M., Zo, H.J., Ciganek, A.P., Understanding the MOOCs continuance: The role of openness and reputation (2015) Computers & Education, 80, pp. 28-38; Anderson, J.C., Gerbing, D.W., Structural equation modeling in practice: A review and recommended two-step approach (1988) Psychological Bulletin, 103, pp. 411-423; Ben-Eliyahu, A., Moore, D., Dorph, R., Schunn, C.D., Investigating the multidimensionality of engagement: Affective, behavioral, and cognitive engagement in science across multiple days, activities, and contexts (2018) Contemporary Educational Psychology, 53, pp. 87-105; Bolliger, D.U., Supanakorn, S., Boggs, C., Impact of podcasting on student motivation in the online learning environment (2010) Computers & Education, 55 (2), pp. 714-722; Cazan, A.M., Learning motivation engagement and burnout among university students (2015) Procedia-Social and Behavioral Sciences, 187, pp. 413-417; Chen, K.C., Jang, S.J., Motivation in online learning: Testing a model of self-determination theory (2010) Computers in Human Behavior, 26, pp. 741-752; Chen, Y.H., Chen, P.J., MOOC study group: Facilitation strategies, influential factors, and student perceived gains (2015) Computers & Education, 86, pp. 55-70; Chen, Y.L.E., Kraklow, D., Taiwanese college students’ motivation and engagement for English learning in the context of internationalization at home: A comparison of students in EMI and non-EMI programs (2015) Journal of Studies in International Education, 19 (1), pp. 46-64; Chin, W.W., Commentary: Issues and opinion on structural equation modeling.

In this article, we discuss a future approach for courses in Higher Education Institutions (HEIs), inspired by the Nordic welfare state model, and MOOC platform technology. Contrary to many earlier MOOC initiatives, where access was free of charge and open to all, we see a commercial freemium trend on MOOC platforms. Now we see a trend towards short, free, ""teaser"" courses that encourage learners to pay for a certificate and to undertake quality assured and accredited micro-master courses hidden behind paywalls. This trend aligns with the principle of paid access to courses on campus in Higher Education in many countries. In this paper, we argue that MOOC platforms should be a vehicle to promote transparency, i.e. open access to high quality, research informed and instructionally designed course content, regardless of the nature of the course. In doing so, universities could contribute to strengthening the quality of content available to all learners on the Internet in the short term (e.g. Facebook Google, and YouTube) and in the long term (democracy, equity and academic thinking). The approach we propose is based on our contribution to a strategic policy document for further education at a larger Nordic university in 2018. © 2019 CEUR-WS.

One example application domain, where this is a requirement, is in relation to Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) when users wish to obtain some kind of certification as evidence that they have successfully competed a course. Such continuous authentication can best be realised using some forms of biometric checking; traditional user credential checking methods, for example username and password checking, only provide for “entry” authentication. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for the continuous authentication of computer users founded on keystroke dynamics (keyboard behaviour patterns); a form of behavioural biometric. The proposed method conceptualises keyboard dynamics in terms of a Multivariate-Keystroke Time Series which in turn can be transformed into the spectral domain. The time series can then be monitored dynamically for typing patterns that are indicative of a claimed user. Two transforms are considered, the Discrete Fourier Transform and the Discrete Wavelet Transform. The proposed method is fully described and evaluated, in the context of impersonation detection, using real keystroke datasets. The reported results indicate that the proposed time series mechanism produced an excellent performance, outperforming the comparator approaches by a significant margin. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Biometrics; Continuous authentication; Keystroke dynamics; Keystroke time series","Behavioral research; Biometrics; Discrete Fourier transforms; Discrete wavelet transforms; Dynamics; Knowledge engineering; Knowledge management; Strain measurement; Time series; Behaviour patterns; Behavioural Biometric; Continuous authentications; Keystroke dynamics; Massive open online course; On-line applications; Spectral domains; User authentication; Authentication",,,,,,,,,,,,"Ahmed, A.A.E., Traore, I., A new biometric technology based on mouse dynamics (2007) IEEE Trans.

Based on value-expectancy theory, an instrument was developed to measure motivation for enrolling in a programming MOOC. A study with 1229 adult participants in Estonian-language programming course “About Programming” was conducted to validate the instrument. Results of confirmatory factor analysis validated the 7-factor scale named factors influencing enrolment in MOOC (FIEM). FIEM comprises three factors of expectancies, three factors of values and one factor of social influence. The highest and lowest rated motivational factors influencing enrolment in programming MOOC are discussed in the paper. Interest in and expectations for the course, personal suitability of distance learning and suitability for family and work are the highest-rated motivational factors for those who enrol in MOOC. Usefulness related to own children, social influence and usefulness to related to certification were the lowest rated. The results of this study can be useful for designers of programming MOOCs and the developed scale might be used in future studies. © 2017 British Educational Research Association",,"Distance education; Factor analysis; Motivation; Confirmatory factor analysis; Massive open online course; One-factor; Programming course; Social influence; Traditional course; Value-expectancy theory; Economic and social effects",,,,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, A., Huttenlocher, D., Kleinberg, J., Leskovec, J., (2014), http://arxiv.org/pdf/1403.3100v2.pdf, .

With MOOCs' ubiquity, openness and accessibility, they have become a new platform for teacher professional development across the globe. Utilizing an ethnographic approach, this study examined aspects of memories, perspectives and experiences of the 17 MOOC participants (4 university instructors and 13 high school teachers) in Manila, the Philippines who successfully completed three MOOCs sponsored by the U.S. Department of State and administered by Family Health International and World Learning via Canvas (www.canvas.net) as the MOOC platform. The completed MOOCs were: Teaching Grammar Communicatively (September 25 - October 29, 2017), Integrating Critical Thinking into the Exploration of Culture in an EFL Setting (February 5 - March 26, 2018), and Using Educational Technology in the English Language Classroom (April 16 - May 21, 2018). Data from individual reflections, journals and focus group discussions revealed that, in general, the participants viewed MOOCs as a practical and effective means for professional development because of their open, free and flexible features, while MOOC camps are seen as a community of practice that engages MOOC participants and sustains their motivation in completing the courses successfully. Furthermore, participants' aims for completing the courses were drawn: to get certification, to have access to quality open educational resources, to participate in a new mode of learning, to acquire new knowledge and skills, inter alia. Andragogical and pedagogical implications are provided in the light of these findings. © 2018 Asian E F L Journal Press.

This has led to changes in educational environments as well as technology, which has removed barriers to participation due to the novelty that it presents for teacher and the learners at the same time. The Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) environment is the best example of this phenomenon where advanced technology is at the forefront and it is an extension of distance learning. By eliminating barriers such as place, time, background and infrastructure, the Massive Online Open Courses act as a guide for lifelong learning and enables learners to achieve rapid development on the, paving the way for learners to obtain certificates and diplomas at their own convenience, provided they have an Internet connection. The aim of this study is to improve a scale that is related to the determination of the teachers’ perspectives and the level of readiness towards traditional Massive Open Online Courses.

The results showed that learners taking part in such MOOCs hold at least a Bachelor's or a Master's degree, and their age is between 26 and 45. The course's certificate acts as a motivational factor for learners to finish the course, and also as participation in activities forecast. It has also been observed that the most prominent reason for learners to participate in the MOOC was their current or future working career development. © 2018 IEEE.","Massive Open Online Courses; MOOCs; Programming; Python","Employment; High level languages; Mathematical programming; Career development; Introduction to programming; Learning behavior; Massive open online course; Master's degree; MOOCs; Python; Python programming; Curricula",,,,,,,,,,,,"Deng, R., Benckendorff, P., A Contemporary Review of Research Methods Adopted to Understand Students' and Instructors' Use of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) (2017) Int.

The research studies the obstacles, challenges and usability issues entailed in the management of a novel MOOC for AR and VR training. The electronic learning form of MOOC has been adapted and made available for a number of universities and organizations. It brings learning opportunities for university students and industrial professionals to go through online-based courses on their own pace, and some MOOCs provide certifications for specialized subjects. However, the nature of working on AR and VR requires specialized equipment such as mobile tablets with high computing capability, workstation with fast graphic processing units (GPU) and head-mount-devices (HMD).

A qualitative study using semi-structured interviews was undertaken with participants on the PGCert to investigate learner experiences of both the MOOC and PGCert, and to establish the extent to which the MOOC supported learners’ transitions into the PGCert in terms of their (1) foundation knowledge, (2) study skills, (3) digital literacies, (4) readiness for self-directed learning, and to determine whether additional efforts could have been directed to more effectively support student transitions. Findings revealed that the MOOC informed participants’ decision to undertake the fully online PGCert, and that this was due to the effective learning design and a strong teacher presence throughout. The participants already possessed some background knowledge and a number of essential learning skills (though not uniformly), questioning assumptions around MOOCs as an aid to widening participation in higher education; however, the MOOC helped to enhance and unify these. Not surprisingly, there were some challenges encountered on entering online postgraduate study that the MOOC design could not anticipate or solve; therefore, we recommend that online learners are appropriately supported throughout their studies. This work has implications in terms of how MOOCs may help facilitate student transitions into other fully online, credit-bearing programmes of study. © 2018 E.

The variables representing uninterrupted time-on-task, such as number and duration of uninterrupted consecutive learning activities, were mined from the log files capturing how 4286 students tried to learn Newtonian mechanics concepts in a MOOC. These variables were used as predictors in the logistic regression model estimating the likelihood of students getting a course certificate at the end of the semester. The analysis results indicate that the predictive power of the logistic regression model, which was assessed by Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC), depends on the value of off-task activity threshold time, and the likelihood of students getting a course certificate increases as students were doing more uninterrupted learning activities over a longer period of time. The findings from this study suggest that a simple count of learning activities, which has been used as a proxy for time-on-task in previous studies, may not accurately describe student learning in the computer-based learning environment because it does not reflect the quality, such as uninterrupted durations, of those learning activities. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Academic success; Log file analysis; Massive open online course (MOOC); Self-regulated learning (SRL); Time-on-task","Computer aided instruction; Regression analysis; Students; Academic success; Log-file analysis; Massive open online course; Self-regulated learning; Time on tasks; E-learning; academic success; article; human; human experiment; learning environment; major clinical study; mechanics; recall; student",,,,,,,,,,,,"Allen, G.J., Lerner, W.M., Hinrichsen, J.J., Study behaviors and their relationships to test anxiety and academic performance (1972) Psychological Reports, 30 (2), pp. 407-410. , http://doi.org/http://doi.org/10.2466/pr0.1972.30.2.407; Ba-Omar, H., Petrounias, I., A framework for using Web usage mining to personalise e-learning (2007) Proceedings of the seventh IEEE international conference on advanced learning technologies, pp. 937-938. , http://doi.org/http://doi.org/10.1109/ICALT.2007.13; Breslow, L., Pritchard, D.E., DeBoer, J.D., Stump, G.S., Ho, A.D., Seaton, D.T., Studying learning in the worldwide classroom: Research into edX's first MOOC (2013) Research Practice in Assessment, 8, pp. 13-25; Carroll, J.B., A model of school learning (1963) Teachers College Record, 64 (8), pp. 723-733; Cho, M.-H., Shen, D., Self-regulation in online learning (2013) Distance Education, 34 (3), pp. 290-301. , http://doi.org/10.1080/01587919.2013.835770; Crossley, S., Paquette, L., Dascalu, M., McNamara, D.S., Baker, R., Combining click-stream data with NLP tools to better understand MOOC completion (2016) Proceedings of the sixth international conference on learning analytics & knowledge, pp. 6-14. , http://doi.org/10.1145/2883851.2883931; Davis, J., Goadrich, M., The relationship between Precision-Recall and ROC curves (2006) Proceedings of the 23rd international conference on world wide Web, pp. 233-240. , http://doi.org/10.1145/1143844.1143874; Duncan, T.G., McKeachie, W.J., The making of the motivated Strategies for learning Questionnaire (2005) Educational Psychologist, 40 (2), pp. 117-128. , http://doi.org/10.1207/s15326985ep4002_6; Eriksson, T., Adawi, T., Stöhr, C., “Time is the bottleneck”: A qualitative study exploring why learners drop out of MOOCs (2016) Journal of Computing in Higher Education, 29 (1), pp. 133-146. , http://doi.org/10.1007/s12528-016-9127-8; Goldberg, L.R., Bell, E., King, C., OMara, C., McInerney, F., Robinson, A., Relationship between participants' level of education and engagement in their completion of the understanding dementia massive open online course (2015) BMC Medical Education, 15 (1), pp. 60-67. , http://doi.org/10.1186/s12909-015-0344-z; Goldhammer, F., Naumann, J., Stelter, A., Tóth, K., Rölke, H., Klieme, E., The time on task effect in reading and problem solving is moderated by task difficulty and skill: Insights from a computer-based large-scale assessment (2014) Journal of Educational Psychology, 106 (3), pp. 608-626. , http://doi.org/10.1037/a0034716; Hone, K.S., Said El, G.R., Exploring the factors affecting MOOC retention: A survey study (2016) Computers & Education, 98 (100), pp. 157-168. , http://doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2016.03.016; Ho, A.D., Reich, J., Nesterko, S.O., Seaton, D.T., Mullaney, T., Waldo, J., HarvardX and MITx: The first year of open online courses, fall 2012-summer 2013 (2014) SSRN Electronic Journal, , http://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2381263; Jordan, K., Massive open online course completion rates revisited: Assessment, length and attrition (2015) The International Review of Research in Open and Distributed Learning, 16 (3). , http://doi.org/10.19173/irrodl.v16i3.2112; Kizilcec, R.F., Halawa, S., Attrition and achievement gaps in online learning (2015) Proceedings of the second ACM conference on learning @ scale, pp. 57-66. , http://doi.org/10.1145/2724660.2724680; Kizilcec, R.F., Piech, C., Schneider, E., Deconstructing disengagement: Analyzing learner subpopulations in massive open online courses (2013) Proceedings of the third international conference on learning analytics and knowledge, pp. 170-179. , http://doi.org/10.1145/2460296.2460330; Kovanović, V., Gašević, D., Dawson, S., Joksimović, S., Baker, R., Hatala, M., Does time-on-task estimation matter?

Fulton Schools of Engineering, Arizona State University, United States","In this evidence-based practice paper, the development and implementation of a new Introduction to Engineering course developed for the massive open online course (MOOC) environment will be discussed. In recent years, a number of universities and colleges have developed MOOCs. While this space within the educational landscape has garnered interest from many of the top schools worldwide, very few of them have actually provided pathways for students in these MOOCs to earn college credit. Most of the schools that have provided such pathways have focused on Master's level programs, rather than undergraduate programs. One first-of-its-kind initiative is Arizona State University's Global Freshman Academy (GFA) in which versions of all first year classes are being developed for this MOOC environment with options to receive college credit from Arizona State University (ASU). The Introduction to Engineering course described in this paper was developed for a Fall 2017 launch as a part of the ASU GFA initiative. This course is the first Introduction to Engineering course offered with pathways for college credit in this MOOC environment. In an attempt to provide the same quality of education to online students as traditional students, this course integrates best practices such as active project-based learning, multi-disciplinary concepts, contextualizing course concepts within industry practices, ePortfolio documentation of skills, and collaborative peer engagement unlike anything currently available in Introduction to Engineering courses in the MOOC community. In the first offering of this course, 4,014 students were enrolled including 69 students who paid a small fee to be ID-verified in order to potentially receive a certificate for completion of the course; 22 students successfully completed the course. This paper describes the course goals, structure, and design including specific challenges related to designing a course for the MOOC environment. The implementation of the course will also be discussed, including preliminary data on the effectiveness obtained from an end-of-course survey administered to students enrolled in the first offering of the course. Insights gained from the first offering of this course as well as recommendations for future work will also be discussed. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2018.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Baggaley, J., MOOC rampant (2013) Distance Education, 34 (3), pp. 368-378; Gettler, L., (2013) Are Free Online Courses a Waste of Time?, , http://www.leadingcompany.com.au/managing-me/are-free-online-coursesa-waste-of-time/201302213745, February 21; Hartman, J., (2013) Online Learning: Everything Old is New Again, , http://www.huffingtonpost.com/joel-hartman/massiveopen-online-course-effectiveness_b_2768926.html, February 27; Zellner, A., (2013) GradHacking the MOOC, , http://www.gradhacker.org/2013/02/25/gradhacking-the-mooc, February 25 [Blog post]; Jordan, K., (2018) MOOC Completion Rates: The Data.

Increasingly, professionals consume this content to augment or update specific skills rather than complete degree or certification programs. To better address the needs of this emergent user population, we describe a visual recommender system called MOOCex. The system recommends lecture videos across multiple courses and content platforms to provide a choice of perspectives on topics of interest. The recommendation engine considers both video content and sequential inter-topic relationships mined from course syllabi. Furthermore, it allows for interactive visual exploration of the semantic space of recommendations within a learner's current context. © 2018 ACM.","Massive open online courses; Multimedia information systems; Users and interactive retrieval","Curricula; Online systems; Recommender systems; Search engines; Semantics; Certification programs; Educational videos; Interactive retrieval; Massive open online course; MultiMedia Information Systems; Multiple course; On-line education; Visual exploration; E-learning",,,,,,,,,,,,"Adcock, J., Cooper, M., Denoue, L., Pirsiavash, H., Rowe, L.A., Talkminer: A lecture webcast search engine (2010) Proceedings of the ACM International Conference on Multimedia (MM '10), pp. 241-250. , https://doi.org/10.1145/1873951.1873986; Agrawal, R., Christoforaki, M., Gollapudi, S., Kannan, A., Kenthapadi, K., Swaminathan, A., (2014) Mining Videos from the Web for Electronic Textbooks, pp. 219-234. , https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-07248-7_16, Springer International Publishing; Bhatt, C., Cooper, M., Zhao, J., Seqsense: Video recommendation using topic sequence mining (2018) MultiMedia Modeling, pp. 252-263. , Klaus Schoeffmann, Thanarat H.

The purpose of this paper is to introduce a different MOOC course style. Typically, video content is shown teaching the student new information. After watching a video, self-Test questions can be answered. Finally, the student answers weekly exams and final exams like the self-Test questions. Out of the points that have been scored for weekly and final exams a certificate can be issued. Our approach extends the possibility to receive points for the final score with practical programming exercises on real hardware. It allows the student to do embedded programming by communicating over GPIO pins to control LEDs and measure sensor values. Additionally, they can visualize values on an embedded display using web technologies, which are an essential part of embedded and smart home devices to communicate with common APIs. Students have the opportunity to solve all tasks within the online remote lab and at home on the same kind of hardware. The evaluation of this MOOCs indicates the interesting design for students to learn an engineering technique with new technology approaches in an appropriate, modern, supporting and motivating way of teaching. © 2018 IEEE.","Distance Learning; E-Learning; Embedded Programming; MOOC Remote Lab; Smart Home Education","Automation; Display devices; Distance education; E-learning; Hardware; Intelligent buildings; Students; Teaching; Embedded programming; Engineering techniques; Massive open online course; New technologies; Programming exercise; Remote-labs; Smart homes; Web technologies; Engineering education",,,,,,,,,,,,"Willems, C., Meinel, C., Online assessment for hands-on cyber security training in a virtual lab (2012) Proceedings of the 2012 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON), pp. 1-10. , April; Ortelt, T.R., Pekasch, S., Lensing, K., Guéno, P.J., May, D., Tekkaya, A.E., Concepts of the international manufacturing remote lab (mintrelab): Combination of a mooc and a remote lab for a manufacturing technology online course (2016) 2016 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON), pp. 602-607. , April; Díaz, G., Loro, F.G., Castro, M., Tawfik, M., Sancristobal, E., Monteso, S., Remote electronics lab within a mooc: Design and preliminary results (2013) 2013 2nd Experiment@ International Conference (exp.at13), pp. 89-93. , Sept; Salzmann, C., Gillet, D., Piguet, Y., Mools for moocs: A first edx scalable implementation (2016) 2016 13th International Conference on Remote Engineering and Virtual Instrumentation (REV), pp. 246-251. , Feb; Malchow, M., Renz, J., Bauer, M., Meinel, C., Embedded smart home-remote lab grading in a mooc with over 6000 participants (2017) 2017 Annual IEEE International Systems Conference (SysCon), pp. 1-6. , April",,,"Coplaca;Cypress;et al.;MathWorks;Pentec Blackboard;UNIRiTED","IEEE Computer Society","2018 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference - Emerging Trends and Challenges of Engineering Education, EDUCON 2018","17 April 2018 through 20 April 2018",,136691,21659559,9781538629574,,,"English","IEEE Global Eng.

Our aim is to investigate their features at the University area. Our ultimate target is to utilize the conclusions and make some specific suggestions regarding the way we can draw on our relevant experience of University Open Courses (UOC) so that the latter will be able to be converted into a Secondary Education (SE) Teachers’ distance - training database. To this aim, we attended MOOCs run by Mathesis, Coursity and the Ionion Universities. Our research aimed at externally describing the respective MOOCs’ features and comparing them with one another. Next, we compare these platforms to the Open eClass Learning Management System (OeC LMS)used by the UOC and we put forward methods to convert these Courses into MOOCs. Additionally, we investigate the cost, the required attendance time and the Certification of the MOOCs, research has taken place as to whether some of the OCs can be converted into MOOCs or Small Private Online Courses(SPOCs).From the conclusions drawn we see that Greek MOOCs have mainly been structured around the behaviouristic model. Suggestions have been made in the direction of collaborative learning with the creation of small groups of SE teachers of the same major, with the view to having OCs function as a database for SE teachers’ training via SPOC, drawing on experience derived from MOOCs. © 2018 The authors and IJLTER.ORG.

In 2012, massive open online courses (MOOCs) started in the U.S., and over 500 schools mainly from the West are now offering courses, which over 30 million people are now taking. In Japan, with the aim of making MOOCs popular, courses certified with the Japan Massive Open Online Education Promotion Council (JMOOC) began in April 2014, and the courses are offered by 45 universities and taken by over 500,000 people. Fujitsu has established ""Fisdom,"" a digital learning platform that provides MOOCs and small private online courses (SPOCs) to diversify and sophisticate education using flipped learning. Fisdom is equipped with functions including discussion boards, where students ask and answer each other's questions to solve problems, and peer evaluations of reports, in which reports submitted by students are evaluated by other students. These functions lead to retention of learning by providing students with opportunities for mutual teaching and learning and helping students give each other advice. In addition, students' lifelong learning can be recorded, which raises expectations for the utilization of their learned knowledge in numerous life events.

While massive open enrolment and the advances of learning technology are creating exciting potentials for lifelong learning in formal and informal ways, the implementation of efficient and effective assessment is still problematic. To ensure that genuine learning occurs, both assessments for learning (formative assessments), which evaluate students’ current progress, and assessments of learning (summative assessments), which record students’ cumulative progress, are needed. Providers’ more recent shift towards the granting of certificates and digital badges for course accomplishments also indicates the need for proper, secure and accurate assessment results to ensure accountability. This article examines possible assessment approaches that fit open online education from formative and summative assessment perspectives. The authors discuss the importance of, and challenges to, implementing assessments of MOOC learners’ progress for both purposes. Various formative and summative assessment approaches are then identified. The authors examine and analyse their respective advantages and disadvantages. They conclude that peer assessment is quite possibly the only universally applicable approach in massive open online education. They discuss the promises, practical and technical challenges, current developments in and recommendations for implementing peer assessment. They also suggest some possible future research directions. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature, and UNESCO Institute for Lifelong Learning.","formative assessment; lifelong learning (LLL); massive open online course (MOOC); peer assessment; summative assessment",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Admiraal, W., Huisman, B., Van de Ven, M., Self- and peer assessment in massive open online courses (2014) International Journal of Higher Education, 3 (3), pp. 119-128; Balfour, S.P., Assessing writing in MOOCs: Automated essay scoring and Calibrated Peer Review™ (2013) Journal of Research and Practice in Assessment, 8 (1), pp. 40-48; Boud, D., Sustainable assessment: Rethinking assessment for the learning society (2000) Studies in Continuing Education, 22 (2), pp. 151-167; Bowen, W.G., (2013) Higher education in the digital age, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ; Breslow, L., Pritchard, D.E., Deboer, J., Stump, G.S., Ho, A.D., Seaton, D.T., Studying learning in the worldwide classroom: Research into edX’s first MOOC (2013) Research and Practice in Assessment, 8 (1), pp. 13-25; Brindley, J., Blaschke, L.M., Walti, C., Creating effective collaborative learning groups in an online environment (2009) The International Review of Research in Open and Distributed Learning, 10 (3). , http://www.irrodl.org/index.php/irrodl/article/view/675/1271, Retrieved 18 January 2018 from; Bulu, S.T., Yildirim, Z., Communication behaviors and trust in collaborative online teams (2008) Educational Technology and Society, 11 (1), pp. 132-147; Chi, M.T.H., Feltovich, P.J., Glaser, R., Categorization and representation of physics problems by experts and novices (1981) Cognitive Science, 5 (2), pp. 121-152; Cho, K., Schunn, C.D., Scaffolded writing and rewriting in the discipline: A web-based reciprocal peer review system (2007) Computers and Education, 48 (3), pp. 409-426; Chung, C., (2015) Futurelearn partners with Pearson VUE for proctored testing.

However, since only a small percentage of enrollees complete MOOCs, it is important to understand participants’ preliminary expectations and motivations. This is particularly important for science and engineering MOOCs because they require professional knowledge, analytical skills, and the ability to handle abstract models of physical phenomena. Hence, the goal of this study was to examine the motivating factors of learners who successfully completed a MOOC in nanotechnology and nanosensors, while comparing between university-affiliated students (N = 114) and general participants (N = 194). Analysis of data, collected via an online survey, forum posts, and email messages, identified three motivational themes: career, personal, and educational. The findings indicated that participants from both groups were motivated by general interest, personal growth, and enrichment. However, while the university-affiliated students were oriented toward improving knowledge and receiving a certificate, the general participants were oriented toward research and professional advancement. Our findings suggest that the design of academic MOOCs should target at both promoting the understanding of new concepts and generating new skillsets. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Massive open online course (MOOC); Motivation to learn; Science and engineering education; University students","Decision making; E-learning; Education; Education computing; Motivation; Nanosensors; Analytical skills; Massive open online course; Physical phenomena; Professional advancement; Professional knowledge; Science and engineering; Strategic decision making; University students; Students",,,,,,,,,,,,"Azarian, R., Potentials and limitations of comparative method in social science (2011) International Journal of Humanities and Social Science, 1 (4), pp. 113-125; Barak, M., Watted, A., Project-based MOOC-enhancing knowledge construction and motivation to learn (2017) Digital tools and solutions for inquiry-based STEM learning, pp. 282-307. , I.

Prior researchers have focused on predicting dropout based upon behavioral features such as student confusion, click-stream patterns, and social interactions. However, few studies have focused on combining student logs with forum data. In this work, we use data from two different offerings of the same MOOC. We conduct a survival analysis to identify likely dropouts. We then examine two classes of features, social and behavioral, and apply a combination of modeling and feature-selection methods to identify the most relevant features to predict both dropout and certification. We examine the utility of three different model types and we consider the impact of different definitions of dropout on the predictors. Finally we assess the reliability of the models over time by evaluating whether or not models from week 1 can predict dropout in week 2, and so on. The outcomes of this study will help instructors identify students likely to fail or dropout as soon as the first two weeks and provide them with more support. © 2018 International Educational Data Mining Society.

Study behavior is correlated with whether or not the student can get a certificate or drop out from a course. It is of predominant importance to identify the particular behavioral patterns and establish an accurate predictive model for the learning results, so that tutors can give well-focused assistance and guidance on specific students. However, the behavioral records of individuals are usually very sparse; behavioral records between individuals are inconsistent in time and skewed in contents. These remain big challenges for the state-of-the-art methods. In this paper, we engage the concept of subgroup as a trade-off to overcome the sparsity of individual behavioral records and inconsistency between individuals. We employ the framework of Exceptional Model Mining (EMM) to discover exceptional student behavior. Various model classes of EMM are applied on dropout rate analysis, correlation analysis between length of learning behavior sequence and course grades, and passing state prediction analysis. Qualitative and quantitative experimental results on real MOOCs datasets show that our method can discover significantly interesting learning behavioral patterns of students. © 2018 International Educational Data Mining Society.

The educational characteristic of MOOCs makes it different from the traditional information goods, and its pricing strategy therefore deserves high attention. By observing that major MOOC platforms started to move from the certificate business model to the subscription one, we focus on the business model selection problem faced by MOOC platforms. In this paper, we construct a game theoretical model with a MOOCs platform, an educational institution, and a group of learners. We study the profitability of three models: the certificate model, the subscription model, and the mixed model. We find that learners' bounded rationality is a key for MOOC platforms to introduce the subscription option to learners. Interestingly, while having some learners overestimating their ability benefits the institution and platform, it does not matter whether learners underestimate themselves or not. © PACIS 2018.","Bounded rationality; Game theory; Massive open online courses; Pricing","Costs; Game theory; Information systems; Information use; Bounded rationality; Business modeling; Educational institutions; Game theoretical models; Information goods; Massive open online course; Pricing strategy; Subscription models; E-learning",,,,,,,,,,,,"Kolowich, S., How EdX plans to earn, and share, revenue from its free online courses (2013) The Chronicle of Higher Education, 21; Hollands, F.

With MOOCs' ubiquity, openness, and accessibility, they have become a new platform for teacher professional development. Utilizing a co-constructed narrative inquiry, this paper aimed to examine aspects of our memories, perspectives, and experiences in successfully completing Teach English Now! a 150-hour online Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL) Certificate Course from Arizona State University, United States of America via Coursera (www.coursera.org) as the MOOC platform. Acting as reflective practitioners and as teachers-as-researchers, we unpacked how we traversed the massive information superhighway in our quest for teacher professional development, what it was like to be an online learner, how we saw our role, why we believe what we believe about MOOCs' potential, and how we think all of these affect our decisions and practices in our classrooms and contexts. Data from our individual journals, individual reflections, and peer discussion revealed how MOOCs' features such as 'openness' and 'flexibility' as afforded by ubiquitous technology, sound course design, and strong learning community support have influenced us personally, socially, and professionally, making it a practical platform for teacher professional advancement particularly in developing countries such as the Philippines.

Motivation for participating in such courses can be very different. Results of previous studies indicate that motivation is associated with persistence in university programs and in online environments. Therefore, is important to understand for which purpose(s) learners use MOOCs and to compare determinants, including motivation, of completion and non-completion. Still, there is shortage of evidence about the motives that are associated with MOOC completion in the light of different motivational theories. The aim of this paper is to compare enrolment motivations of completers and non-completers in programming MOOC. Studying motivation in MOOC, we rely on the expectancy-value theory, because task value as a main component of this theory is especially relevant for research aiming to explain people’s voluntary engagement in learning and for understanding what causes a person to initially choose to take part in a MOOC we need to understand value and worth of this MOOC for the participant. Two research questions were posed: (1) What are the main motivating factors for completers and non-completers of a programming MOOC? (2) What are the differences in motivation factors between completers and non-completers? Validated FIEM (Factors Influencing Enrolment in MOOCs) scale was used collecting data from 1,302 participants. The data on completion or non-completion of the MOOC was taken from the learning environment. Evaluation of the participants has been analyzed using seven factors discovered in previous research. Using multivariate analyses of variance with the Bonferroni adjustment statistically significant differences were found in four factors: ‘interest and expectancies for course’, ‘personal suitability of distance learning’, ‘usefulness related to certification’, and ‘social influence’. All these factors were rated higher by completers than by non-completers. Recommendation could be made for taking account these motivational factors to decrease dropout in MOOCs. © The Authors, 2018.

A survey was constructed and the statistical analysis was adopted to evaluate the medical MOOCs. The results showed that the medical MOOC-related journal papers, conference papers, books and dissertations have risen dramatically over the past five years. In addition, the top 6 most representative MOOC platforms provide the majority (87%) of medical courses. The statistical analysis showed that PMPH-MOOC was the most influential medical MOOC platform in China. Compared to the foreign medical MOOCs, medical MOOCs in China were urgently in need of systemic planning, interaction activities and international certification. Overall, the findings suggest that the development of medical MOOCs for higher education has been achieved a great success along with a huge challenge. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

Through the analysis of in-depth interviews of nine cases, five qualitative categories of perceived values with structural hierarchy were profiled and analyzed: (1) learning new knowledge, skills, and perspectives, (2) verifying learning process using certificates, (3) supporting on-campus learning and teaching, (4) solving real-world problems at work, and (5) co-learning with world-wide learners.

Especially self-regulated and goal-oriented learning have been identified as critical skills to be successful in online learning environments with low guidance like MOOCs, but technical support is rare. Therefore, this paper examines the current technical capabilities and limitations of goal-oriented learning in MOOCs. An observational study to explore how well learners in five MOOCs achieved their initial learning objectives was conducted, and the results are compared with similar studies. Afterwards, a concept with a focus on technical feasibility and automation outlines how personalized learning objectives can be supported and implemented on a MOOC platform. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","E-learning; Goal-oriented learning; Learning analytics; Learning objectives; MOOCs; Self-regulated learning","Computer aided instruction; Engineering education; Goal-oriented; Learning analytics; Learning objectives; MOOCs; Self-regulated learning; E-learning",,,,,,,,,,,,"Che, X., Yang, H., Meinel, C., Adaptive E-Lecture video outline extraction based on slides analysis (2015) ICWL 2015.

Academic institutions need high-quality preparatory curricula and mentorship to prepare learners for potential challenges in ethics, cultural sensitivity, and personal safety; however, availability and quality of these are variable. Objective: The objective of this study is to create and evaluate an open-access, interactive massive open online course (MOOC) that prepares learners to safely and effectively participate in STEGH, permits flexible and asynchronous learning, is free of charge, and provides a certificate upon successful completion. Methods: Global health experts from 8 countries, 42 institutions, and 7 specialties collaborated to create The Practitioner’s Guide to Global Health (PGGH): the first course of this kind on the edX platform. Demographic data, pre- and posttests, and course evaluations were collected and analyzed. Results: Within its first year, PGGH enrolled 5935 learners from 163 countries. In a limited sample of 109 learners, mean posttest scores were significantly improved (p < 0.01). In the course’s second year, 213 sampled learners had significant improvement (p < 0.001). Conclusion: We created and evaluated the first interactive, asynchronous, free-of-charge global health preparation MOOC. The course has had significant interest from US-based and international learners, and posttest scores have shown significant improvement. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

Visual materials such as videos and discussion forums are basic ways of engaging students in MOOCs. Student achievement in MOOCs is typically measured using assessments distributed throughout the course. Although there is research on the basic forms of student’s engagement and assessment in MOOCs, little is known about their effect on students’ achievement in the form of students completing a MOOC. Using binomial logistic regression models, this paper addresses this gap in the literature by presenting the degree to which student engagement with videos and forum posts can predict students’ probability of achievement in a MOOC. It also explores the extent to which participation behaviors and their intention to receive the course certification can be used to predict achievement in MOOCs. Using qualitative content analysis, this paper discusses the quality of the forum posts exchanged by participants in this MOOC. The findings from quantitative analysis support MOOC’s pedagogical assumptions, showing that students’ engagement in forums and with videos increases the probability of course achievement. It also shows that intention to certify plays a moderator effect on the number of videos watched, enhancing achievement in MOOCs. The findings from qualitative analysis reveal that most students’ posts in forums display more information acquisition than critical thinking. Implications for practice suggest MOOC designers and MOOC instructors foster engagement in forums by implementing discussion prompts that foster interactions about deep meaning of concepts or application of concepts covered in the MOOC. In regard to videos, implications for practice suggest the creation of interactive videos that promote students’ engagement and control such as inserting guiding questions and segmenting the video content. Future research comprising multiple MOOC cohorts is suggested to validate the empirical model presented in this study. © 2017, The Online Learning Consortium.

Many MOOC learners enroll in the courses to take a brief look; only a few go through the entire content, and even fewer are able to eventually obtain a certificate. We discovered this phenomenon after having examined 92 courses on both xuetangX and edX platforms. More specifically, we found that the learning coverage in many courses-one of the metrics used to estimate the learners' active engagement with the online courses-observes a Zipf distribution. We apply the maximum likelihood estimation method to fit the Zipf's law and test our hypothesis using a chi-square test. In the xuetangX dataset, the learning coverage in 53 of 76 courses fits Zipf's law, but in all of 16 courses on the edX platform, the learning coverage rejects the Zipf's law. The result from our study is expected to bring insight to the unique learning behavior on MOOC. © 2017 by the authors.","Learning coverage; Maximum likelihood estimation; MOOC; Zipf distribution","Computational linguistics; Curricula; E-learning; Maximum likelihood; Maximum likelihood estimation; Statistical tests; Chi-square tests; Learning behavior; Learning coverage; Massive open online course; Maximum likelihood estimation method; MOOC; Statistical distribution; Zipf distribution; Education",,,,,"2016ZD302; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 11690023, 61073008, 61272087, 61363019, 61440057; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC: 2016YFB1000602, 2017YFB0701501; Science and Technology Planning Project of Shenzhen Municipality: CXZZ 20140902110505864, JCYJ 20151117173236192","Acknowledgments: This research is supported in part by MOE research center for online education foundation (No. 2016ZD302), the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Nos. 2016YFB1000602, 2017YFB0701501), National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 61440057, 61272087, 61363019, 61073008 and 11690023), and Shenzhen Science and Technology Project (Nos.

Participants were 779 MOOC students internationally who participated in at least 303 different MOOCs offered by at least 12 providers. MOOC participants most commonly intended to receive, and in actuality received, free and paid course certificates of completion; other incentives (e.g., digital badges, postsecondary credits) were far less common. In addition, MOOC participants' intentions to receive both free and paid certificates were consistently and positively related to perceived learning and course completion, net other factors.

Methods: A 5-week MOOC on behavioral medicine was hosted on the edX platform. The authors developed two branched virtual patients consisting of video recordings of a live standardized patient, with multiple clinical decision points and narration unfolding depending on learners' choices. Students interacted with the virtual patients to treat stress and sleep problems. Answers to the exit survey and participant comments from the discussion forum were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. Results: In total, 19,236 participants enrolled in the MOOC, out of which 740 received the final certificate. The virtual patients were completed by 2317 and 1640 participants respectively. Among survey respondents (n = 442), 83.1% agreed that the virtual patient exercise was helpful. The qualitative analysis resulted in themes covering what it was like to work with the virtual patient, with subthemes on learner-centered education, emotions/eustress, game comparisons, what the participants learned, what surprised them, how confident participants felt about applying interventions in practice, suggestions for improvement, and previous experiences of virtual patients. Conclusions: Students were enthusiastic about interacting with the virtual patients as a means to apply new knowledge about behavioral medicine interventions. The most common suggestion was to incorporate more interactive cases with various levels of complexity. Further research should include patient outcomes and focus on interprofessional aspects of learning with virtual patients in a MOOC. © 2017 The Author(s).","Behavioral medicine; Case-based learning; Evaluation; MOOC; Qualitative content analysis; Virtual patient","adult; behavioral medicine; education; human; medical education; medical student; procedures; qualitative research; simulation training; virtual reality; Adult; Behavioral Medicine; Education, Distance; Education, Medical; Humans; Qualitative Research; Simulation Training; Students, Medical; Virtual Reality",,,,,"Karolinska Institutet, KI","Funding Sources This work was supported by Karolinska Institutet and the International Society of Behavioral Medicine.",,,,,,"Perna, L.W., Ruby, A., Boruch, R.F., Wang, N., Scull, J., Ahmad, S., Moving through MOOCs: Understanding the progression of users in massive open online courses (2014) Educ Res, 43 (9), pp. 421-432; Hauer, K.E., Carney, P.A., Chang, A., Satterfield, J., Behavior change counseling curricula for medical trainees: A systematic review (2012) Acad Med, 87 (7), p. 956. , 22622220 3386427; Triola, M., Feldman, H., Kalet, A., Zabar, S., Kachur, E., Gillespie, C., A randomized trial of teaching clinical skills using virtual and live standardized patients (2006) J Gen Intern Med, 21 (5), pp. 424-429. , 1:STN:280:DC%2BD283nsFyrug%3D%3D 16704382 1484797; Ellaway, R., Poulton, T., Fors, U., McGee, J.B., Albright, S., (2009) Building a virtual patient commons, , Medical teacher; Cook, D.A., Triola, M.M., Virtual patients: A critical literature review and proposed next steps (2009) Med Educ, 43 (4), pp. 303-311. , 19335571; Poulton, T., Ellaway, R.H., Round, J., Jivram, T., Kavia, S., Hilton, S., Exploring the efficacy of replacing linear paper-based patient cases in problem-based learning with dynamic web-based virtual patients: Randomized controlled trial (2014) J Med Internet Res, 16 (11), p. e240. , 25373314 4259985; Cook, D.A., Brydges, R., Hamstra, S.J., Zendejas, B., Szostek, J.H., Wang, A.T., Comparative effectiveness of technology-enhanced simulation versus other instructional methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis (2012) Simul Healthc, 7 (5), pp. 308-320; Cook, D.A., Levinson, A.J., Garside, S., Dupras, D.M., Erwin, P.J., Montori, V.M., Instructional design variations in internet-based learning for health professions education: A systematic review and meta-analysis (2010) Academic Medicine: Journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges, 85 (5), pp. 909-922; Kononowicz, A.A., Zary, N., Edelbring, S., Corral, J., Hege, I., Virtual patients - What are we talking about?

However, in contrast to traditional classroom settings, many aspects of learners' behaviour in MOOCs are not well researched. In this work, we focus on modelling learner behaviour in the context of continuous assessments with completion certificates, the most common assessment setup in MOOCs today. Here, learners can obtain a completion certificate once they obtain a required minimal score (typically somewhere between 50 - 70%) in tests distributed throughout the duration of a MOOC. In this se.ing, the course material or tests provided a.er ""passing"" do not contribute to earning the certi€cate (which is ungraded), thus potentially affecting learners' behaviour. Therefore, we explore how ""passing"" impacts MOOC learners: do learners alter their behaviour after this point? And if so how?

It is termed CAMEO – Copying Answers using Multiple Existence Online. A person using CAMEO sets up one or more harvesting accounts for collecting correct answers; these are then submitted in the user's master account for credit. The study has three main goals: Determining the prevalence of CAMEO, studying its detailed characteristics, and inferring the motivation(s) for using it. For the physics course that we studied, about 10% of the certificate earners used this method to obtain more than 1% of their correct answers, and more than 3% of the certificate earners used it to obtain the majority (>50%) of their correct answers. We discuss two of the likely consequences of CAMEO: jeopardizing the value of MOOC certificates as academic credentials, and generating misleading conclusions in educational research. Based on our study, we suggest methods for reducing CAMEO. Although this study was conducted on a MOOC, CAMEO can be used in any learning environment that enables students to have multiple accounts. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Academic dishonesty; Educational data mining; Learning analytics; MOOCs","Computer aided instruction; Data mining; Harvesting; Academic dishonesty; Educational data mining; Educational research; Learning analytics; Learning environments; Massive open online course; MOOCs; Education",,,,,,,,,,,,"Aleven, V., Roll, I., McLaren, B.M., Koedinger, K.R., Help helps, but only so Much: Research on help seeking with intelligent tutoring systems (2016) International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education, 26 (1), pp. 205-223. , http://doi.org/10.1007/s40593-015-0089-1; Alexandron, G., Ruipérez-Valiente, J.A., Pritchard, E.D., Evidence of MOOC students using multiple accounts to harvest correct answers.

Of the 5285 learners in 81 different countries, 1237 (23%) were successfully certified. This MOOC was also integrated into the teaching program of medical students of Paris Diderot University and Paris 13 University. Using anonymous questionnaires before and after MOOC, it has been shown that pathology is less known than other medical specialties. Participation in this MOOC led to a marked improvement in participants’ knowledge of the place and role of the pathologist in the diagnosis of cancers. Regarding the students who have followed the MOOC as part of their university course, their comments were very positive, but it is necessary to make substantial adjustments in the amounts and contents of the campus-based courses. © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS","Cancer; Internet; Massive open online course (MOOC); Medical education; Pathology; Teaching","autumn; biology; cancer epidemiology; case report; diagnosis; France; human; Internet; medical education; medical student; pathologist; pathology; questionnaire; university; adult; attitude; education; female; male; neoplasm; pathology; teaching; Adult; Attitude; Computer-Assisted Instruction; Education, Distance; Female; Humans; Male; Neoplasms; Pathology, Clinical",,,,,,,,,,,,"Gardair, C., Bousquet, G., Lehmann-Che, J., de Bazelaire, C., de Cremoux, P., Tran Van Nhieu, J., Backstage of a massive open online course (MOOC) on cancer diagnosis (2016) Ann Pathol, 36, pp. 305-311; Subhi, Y., Andresen, K., Bojsen, S.R., Nilsson, P.M., Konge, L., Massive open online courses are relevant for postgraduate medical training (2014) Dan Med, 61, p.

This intention-action gap is found in many domains of human experience, and research in similar goal pursuit domains suggests that plan-making is a cheap and effective nudge to encourage follow-through. In a natural field experiment in three HarvardX courses, some students received open-ended planning prompts at the beginning of a course. These prompts increased course completion by 29%, and payment for certificates by 40%. This effect was largest for students enrolled in traditional schools. Furthermore, the contents of students' plans could predict which students were least likely to succeed - in particular, students whose plans focused on specific times were unlikely to complete the course. Our results suggest that planning prompts can help learners adopted productive frames of mind at the outset of a learning goal that encourage and forecast student success. © 2017 ACM.","Learning analytics;

Using an established online platform, the authors created and delivered a five-week MOOC aimed primarily at prospective veterinary students, but open to anyone with an interest in finding out more about the veterinary profession in general. 11,911 people signed up for the course, and of these, 8137 interacted in some way with the course and 1716 received a certificate of completion. The majority of participants (84 per cent) were female, and there was a wide age range (under 18 to over 65). Most participants were from North America or the UK. 65 per cent of those completing the entry survey were hoping or intending to work in the vet profession in the future, while 33 per cent were not. Qualitative data indicated that the course was helpful in aiding those undecided as to whether they wanted to be a veterinarian or not to decide one way or another whether they want to pursue veterinary medicine as a career. Furthermore, the course was seen as being a useful introduction to the veterinary profession even for those who had no intention of working in the field. © British Veterinary Association.","MOOC; Vet degree; Veterinary profession","adolescent; adult; curriculum; education; female; health student; human; Internet; male; middle aged; organization and management; psychology; qualitative research; statistics and numerical data; teaching; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Computer-Assisted Instruction; Curriculum; Education, Veterinary; Female; Humans; Internet; Male; Middle Aged; Qualitative Research; Students, Health Occupations; Young Adult",,,,,,,,,,,,"Aguaded-Gomez, J.I., The MOOC Revolution: A new form of education from the technological paradigm?

Indeed, data acquired through assessment activities are used, on the one hand to enhance students learning, institutional planning, on the other hand to evaluate periodically the assessment process. In MOOCs, assessment is not an easy task for tutors/teachers, because of the massive number of participants. In this paper, we propose an assessment planner in a MOOC platform based on ODALA approach, to enhance the building, planning of evaluation activities. Consequently, we aim to reduce the high dropout rate of learners, which is one of the most known challenges for MOOCs that is usually justified by the lack of motivation to fulfill the learning. Through this study, we have the objective to gradually improve the learners' knowledge, enhance their motivation by an adaptive planning of pedagogical activities based on learners' profiling. The proposition has been evaluated by a feasibility study where a prototype of a MOOC platform integrating the evaluation planner was developed, tested with a test set, simulated users. © 2016 IEEE.","Assessment planner; Automated assessment; Learner certification; Learner motivation; Learner profile; Massive Open Online Course (MOOC); ODALA approach","Big data; Education; Motivation; Students; Teaching; Trusted computing; Assessment planner; Automated assessment; Learner certification; Learner profiles; Massive open online course; ODALA approach; Ubiquitous computing",,,,,,,,,,,,"Rosenberg, M.J., (2001) E-learning: Strategies for Delivering Knowledge in the Digital Age, , New York: McGraw-Hill; Porta, M., E-Learning and MOOCs: A short investigation in the context of the FETCH European thematic network (2015) Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Computer Systems and Technologies, ACM, pp. 319-325; S.Downes Blog, , http://halfanhour.blogspot.com/2012/02/e-learning-generations.html, Consulted on: 08/12/2015; Vardi, M.Y., Will MOOCs destroy academia (2012) Commun.

Although the use of MOOCs in Malaysian Universities are evident from the Malaysian OpenLeanring MOOCs portal, still the millions of learners who have already participated in MOOCS, do not move to the stage of obtaining a completion certificate (Kolowick, 2013). As such, in the context of Malaysia, there seems to be a serious concern for all those who wish to implement MOOCs in their pedagogical system. This research employed the bootstrapping resampling approach of Shrout and Bolger (2002) to assess the mediating effects of Intention to Enroll in MOOCs (IE).

MOOCs demonstrate universities’ efforts in offering high-quality digital learning materials to everyone in the world, which should be encouraged. Nevertheless, as a MOOC platform must ensure its financial sustainability, it is questionable whether a platform’s profit-seeking pricing strategy will hurt the diversity of courses, such as eliminating courses with low certificate purchasing rates. To address this question, we adopt a game-theoretic framework to model the interaction and strategic choices of a MOOC platform, learners, and universities. Based on the certificate prices and revenue sharing ratios chosen by the platform for courses with various certificate purchasing rates, universities consider the competition intensity and decide their course quality levels, to attract learners. We conclude that all types of course will exists in equilibrium throughout the lifecycle of a MOOC platform, regardless of the technology maturity and competition intensity. We also find that course qualities may decrease when MOOCs become more accessible to learners. Finally, qualities of courses with different certificate purchasing rates are compared. © PACIS 2017.","Diversification; Game Theory; Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs); Multisided Platforms; Pricing","Costs; Economics; Game theory; Information systems; Information use; Life cycle; Sales; Course qualities; Digital learning materials; Financial sustainability; Higher education; Massive open online course; Pricing strategy; Strategic choice; Technology maturity; E-learning",,,,,,,,,,,,"Arcidiacono, P., Affirmative action in higher education: How do admission and financial aid rules affect future earnings?

However, the occurrence of academic dishonesty has been threatening MOOC certificates’ effectiveness as a serious tool for recruiters and employers. Recently, a large-scale study on the log traces from more than one hundred MOOCs created by Harvard and MIT has identified a specific cheating strategy viable in MOOCs: Copying Answers using Multiple Existences Online (CAMEO). In essence, learners create several accounts on a MOOC platform, request assessment solutions via some of the accounts, and then submit these “harvested” solutions in their main account to receive credit. In our work, we replicate the CAMEO implementation and apply it to ten edX MOOCs created by the Delft University of Technology. Our results show that in those MOOCs, 1.9% of certificates were likely earned through CAMEO cheating, a number comparable to the fraction of cheating observed in Harvard and MIT MOOCs. © 2017 International Educational Data Mining Society.

However, there are still many details that remain unknown about the strategies that students follow while studying online. In this study, we focus on the direction of detecting 'invisible' collaboration ties between students in online learning environments. Specifically, the paper presents a method developed to detect student ties based on temporal proximity of their assignment submissions. The paper reports on findings of a study that made use of the proposed method to investigate the presence of close submitters in two different massive open online courses. The results show that most of the students (i.e., student user accounts) were grouped as couples, though some bigger communities were also detected. The study also compared the population detected by the algorithm with the rest of user accounts and found that close submitters needed a statistically significant lower amount of activity with the platform to achieve a certificate of completion in a MOOC. These results confirm that the detected close submitters were performing some collaboration or even engaged in unethical behaviors, which facilitates their way into a certificate. However, more work is required in the future to specify various strategies adopted by close submitters and possible associations between the user accounts. © 2017 International World Wide Web Conference Committee (IW3C2), published under Creative Commons CC BY 4.0 License.","Academic dishonesty; Algorithm; Collaborative learning; Educational data mining; Online learning","Algorithms; Computer aided instruction; Data mining; Students; World Wide Web; Academic dishonesty; Amount of activities; Collaborative learning; Data-driven methods; Educational data mining; Massive open online course; Online learning; Online learning environment; E-learning",,,,,"Generalitat Valenciana: S2013/ICE-2715, TIN2014-53199-C3-1-R; China National Offshore Oil Corporation, CNOOC; Shanghai Municipal Commission of Economy and Informatization, SHEITC: 562080-EPP- 1-2015-BE-EPPKA3-PI-FORWARD; Erasmus+: 561533-EPP-1-2015-1-ES-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP, 562080-EPP-1-2015-BE-EPPKA3-PI-FORWARD","Work partially funded by the Madrid Regional Government with grant No. S2013/ICE-2715, the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness project RESET (TIN2014- 53199-C3-1-R), and the European Erasmus+ projects MOOC Maker (561533-EPP-1-2015-1-ES-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP) and SHEILA (562080-EPP- 1-2015-BE-EPPKA3-PI-FORWARD).","Work partially funded by the Madrid Regional Government with grant No. S2013/ICE-2715, the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness project RESET (TIN2014-53199-C3-1-R), and the European Erasmus+ projects MOOC Maker (561533-EPP-1-2015-1-ES-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP) and SHEILA (562080-EPP-1-2015-BE-EPPKA3-PI-FORWARD).",,,,,"Adamopoulos, P., What makes a great MOOC?

The chapter has three themes: the political economy of MOOCs, their pedagogy, and their relationship to lifelong learning and adult education. Speight argues that early hopes for MOOCs to widen access to adult and higher education are replaced by the positioning of MOOCs as routes into fee-paying, post-experience, and certificated learning. Currently available evidence suggests that it is postgraduate learners who possess the motivation and skills to benefit most from MOOCs. There are views, however, that MOOCs support teaching enhancement and innovation more generally as universities enable greater use of digital learning. © The Author(s) 2018.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Allen, E., Seamen, J., (2013) Changing course: Ten years of tracking online education in the United States.

Through Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), the individuals follow the education and can get certificates due to these trainings. This study aims to determine how often the students benefit from their social media accounts for self-development and also to determine how the use of MOOCs program via social media cause a positive effect for the future studies. The 248 students who participated in this study have expressed that they had followed their accounts regarding to their fields and also had obtained information from these pages. The participants said that, they had created many solutions for too much difficulties they face in real life and visual, written materials and videos loaded on social media. They have also mentioned that, they preferred the social media rather than obtaining information from pages related to MOOCs. The students who want to attend to any certificate program on social media said that; their social media accounts that they follow daily on either web or mobile media is an information obtaining and transferring tool. They have pointed out that, the duration and quality of videos they reach on social media was important and when they are high quality they obtain more permanent information. The questionnaire of the study was developed by the researcher. The research is quantitative and the data analysis was done by SPSS program. The data were solved and interpreted through tabulating the frequency, percentage and descriptive analyze. In future studies; experimental studies will be held by creating a MOOCs page on social media. © 2018 The Authors.

The promises behind MOOCs stand on delivering free and open education to the public, as well as training a large criterion of students. However, MOOCs clashes severely with students dropout which by then forced educationalists to deeply think of MOOCs effectivity from all angles. As a result, the authors of this paper propose a pedagogical idea that strongly depends on injecting the online learning (MOOC) with face-to-face sessions to refresh the students minds as well as integrating them in the real learning process. The authors after that analyze the results of their experiment using Learning Analytics. The outcomes have shown a new record of certification ratio (35.4%), an improvement of student interaction in the MOOC platform, and a manifest in social interaction in the MOOC discussion forum. © Copyright 2017.","Imoox; Inverse blended learning; Learning Analytics; MOOC","E-learning; Learning systems; Online systems; Students; Teaching; Blended learning; Imoox; Learning Analytics; Massive open online course; MOOC; Social interactions; Student interactions; Technology enhanced learning; Education",,,,,,"* Author’s research is supported by the Leiden-Delft-Erasmus Centre for Education and Learning",,,,,,"Perry, M., Online, bigger classes may be better classes (2010) The Chronicle of Higher Education, , http://www.chronicle.com/article/Open-Teaching-When-the/124170, last accessed 2017/08/07; McAuley, A., Stewart, B., Siemens, G., Massive open online courses digital ways of knowing and learning (2010) The MOOC Model for Digital Practice, , http://www.elearnspace.org/Articles/MOOC_Final.pdf, last accessed 2017/08/07; Carson, S., Schmidt, J., The massive open online professor academic matter (2012) Journal of Higher Education, , http://www.academicmatters.ca/2012/05/the-massive-openonline-professor, last accessed 2017/08/07; Pappano, L., Massive open online courses are multiplying at a rapid pace (2012) The New York Times, , http://www.egymodern.com/2011/07/al-nahar-chaneel.html, last accessed 2017/08/07; Siemens, G., Connectivism: A learning theory for the digital age (2005) International Journal of Instructional Technology and Distance Learning, 2 (1), pp. 3-10; Daniel, J., Making sense of MOOCs: Musings in a maze of myth, paradox and possibility (2012) Journal of Interactive Media in Education, 3. , http://wwwjime.open.ac.uk/jime/article/viewArticle/2012-18/html, last accessed 2017/08/07; Khalil, M., Ebner, M., When learning analytics meets moocs - A review on imoox case studies (2016) Innovations for Community Services: 16th International Conference, I4CS 2016, pp. 3-19. , Vienna, Austria, June 27-29, Revised Selected Papers.

For this purpose, the research employed an embedded single case study using heuristic inquiry to collect data. The researchers participated in three xMOOCs and took into consideration the characteristics of these MOOCs by rating them as low, medium or high in terms of Conole's 12 dimensions. Inter-rater reliability was 92 percent. The study showed that the openness, massiveness, diversity, use of multimedia, communication among learners, learning pathway and amount of reflection dimensions were high. The communication with instructors, degree of collaboration and autonomy dimensions were medium, and the quality assurance, certification, and formal learning dimensions were low. After explaining characteristics of xMOOCs from the perspective of open learning, the study highlighted that xMOOCs dramatically differ with regard to the implementation of the freemium business model to education and course delivery methods. It was concluded that MOOCs are not a new form of learning, but a new form of organizing learning similar to the open university movement, but which promises more flexibility and access than open universities.","Lifelong learning; Massive open online courses; MOOCs; Open and distance learning; Open universities",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Adams, C., Yin, Y., Vargas Madriz, L.F., Mullen, C.S., A phenomenology of learning large: The tutorial sphere of xMOOC video lectures (2014) Distance Education, 35 (2), pp. 202-216; Aydin, C.H., (2013) MOOCs: Are they really new?

Current online courses are massive and online, thus it is important to find new strategies to improve the effectiveness of evaluation. In MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses), indeed, there is also the certification of knowledge and skills acquisition that requires more formal and trustworthy methods. Researchers should work to combine pedagogical and technological solutions to guarantee the effectiveness of learning measures. In this context, the Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT) could be useful to better measure the knowledge acquisition using a quiz, as usually happens in MOOCs. These are the premises of this research work that, to understand if CAT could be suitable for assessment in MOOCs, proposes a first algorithm to measure the acquired knowledge using a quiz-game. The pilot study attests the users’ appreciation. © 2017, Italian e-Learning Association.

Registrants approach these courses with a variety of motivations for participation. Characterizing the different types of participation in MOOCs is fundamental in order to be able to better evaluate the phenomenon and to support MOOCs developers and instructors in devising courses which are adapted for different learners' needs. Thus, the purpose of this study was to characterize the different types of participant behavior in a MOOC. Using a data mining methodology, 21,889 participants of a MOOC were classified into clusters, based on their activity in the main learning resources of the course: video lectures, discussion forums, and assessments. Thereafter, the participants in each cluster were characterized in regard to demographics, course participation, and course achievement characteristics. Seven types of participant behavior were identified: Tasters (64.8%), Downloaders (8.5%), Disengagers (11.5%), Offline Engagers (3.6%), Online Engagers (7.4%), Moderately Social Engagers (3.7%), and Social Engagers (0.6%). A significant number of 1,020 participants were found to be engaged in the course, but did not achieve a certificate. The types are discussed according to the established research questions. The results provide further evidence regarding the utilization of the flexibility, which is offered in MOOCs, by the participants according to their needs. Furthermore, this study supports the claim that MOOCs' impact should not be evaluated solely based on certification rates but rather based on learning behaviors.","Cluster analysis; Educational data mining; Massive open online course; Types of participant behavior",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Anders, A., Theories and applications of massive online open courses (MOOCs): The case for hybrid design (2015) The International Review of Research in Open and Distributed Learning, 16 (6). , http://dx.doi.org/10.19173/irrodl.v16i6.2185; Baker, R., Siemens, G., Educational data mining and learning analytics (2014) Cambridge handbook of the learning sciences, pp. 253-274. , In K.

The prediction of certificate accomplishment can enable the early detection of students at risk, in order to perform interventions before it is too late. This study applies different machine learning techniques to predict which students are going to get a certificate during different timeframes. The purpose is to be able to analyze how the quality metrics change when the models have more data available. From the four machine learning techniques applied finally we choose a boosted trees model which provides stability in the prediction over the weeks with good quality metrics.

As a form of largely free and self-paced education, MOOCs are less formal than creditbearing university courses. It is often the case that MOOCs do not count toward a formal university qualification, and that majority learners enter MOOCs for various purposes other than specifically gaining a certificate. As a result, assessment and critical thinking, valued by universities as important learning outcomes are thought to be less relevant to MOOCs learners or designers. In the last couple of years, however, a few universities have started to design credit-bearing MOOCs as part of university programs. The aim is to encourage quality learning and outcomes that satisfy formal university assessment criteria. MOOCs designed to target particular groups of professionals for career advancement are also emerging. Both trends require a rethink of the relevance of assessment and critical thinking in MOOCs. This paper provides a case study of a MOOC targeted at health professionals, which demonstrates how self- and peer-assessment are designed to encourage critical thinking, and includes a discussion on future directions and constraints of this work-in-progress. The paper proposes that critical thinking is relevant for learning in MOOCs and that carefully designed assessment tasks are essential for developing MOOCs’ learners’ critical thinking. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Critical thinking; Learning outcomes; MOOCs; Peer-assessment; Self-assessment","Curricula; Education; Learning systems; Critical thinking; Learning outcome; MOOCs; Peer assessment; Self assessment; E-learning",,,,,,,,,,,,"Jordan, K., Initial trends in enrolment and completion of massive open online courses.

In January 2016, based in previous trials, edx.org discontinued the free honor code certificate for new courses, trying to increase the number of verified certificates sold. After one year we have studied the effects of this measure in completion rates and verified certification rates over enrollments for 24 UPValenciaX courses offered in 2015 and 2016 (199,278 enrollments in total), finding that there has been a modest global increase in verified certification rates and a strong decline in completion rates for all the courses. For exactly the same courses, the completion rate for all courses has practically halved going from 10.5% in 2015 to 5.6% and the total verified certification rate has been multiplied by 1.4 going from 0.7% to 1%, what is a significant relative improvement but it is not enough to achieve sustainability. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Free certificate; Massive open online course; MOOC; Motivation","Education; Motivation; Controversial topics; Free certificate; Massive open online course; MOOC; E-learning",,,,,,,,,,,,"Jordan, K., Massive open online course completion rates revisited: Assessment, length and attrition (2015) Int.

Despite various features and benefits offered by MOOCs, however, unlike traditional classroom-style education, students enrolled in MOOCs often show a wide variety of motivations, and only quite a small percentage of them participate in the final examinations. To figure out the underlying reasons, in this paper, we make two key contributions. First, we find that being an examinee for a learner is almost a necessary condition of earning a certificate and hence investigation of the examinee rate prediction is of great importance. Second, after conducting extensive investigation of participants’ operation behaviours, we carefully select a set of features that are closely reflect participants’ learning behaviours. We apply existing commonly used classifiers over three online courses, generously provided by China University MOOC platform, to evaluate the effectiveness of the used features. Based on our experiments, we find there does not exist a single classifier that is able to dominate others in all cases, and in many cases, SVN performs the best. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Examinee rate; Machine learning methods; MOOC; Prediction","Big data; Data mining; Database systems; Education; Forecasting; Information management; Learning systems; Quality management; Semantics; Students; Teaching; Final examinations; Machine learning methods; Massive open online course; MOOC; Online course; Rate predictions; E-learning",,,,,"Renmin University of China, RUC: 15XNLF09, 2015-ms007, 297615121721, 297616331721; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","Hong Chen is the corresponding author of this paper.

More universities are willing to offer their top notch professor’s courses as MOOC. However, when utilizing the knowledge from MOOCs, learners need to go through a number of hurdles—getting course completion certification (MS Global Learning Consortum: An example of LIP accessibility information, IMS Global Learning Consortium Inc., 2001, [10]) from various providers, get recognition of the knowledge level of a MOOC in the related domain, and make it searchable for various purposes. In this paper, we propose a MOOC course certifying agency framework, which merges learners’ profiles from various MOOC providers so consolidated profiles are available in one place. Standards such as IMS LIP and Dublin Core (Feigenbaum and Prud’Hommeaux in SPARQL by example: a tutorial, Cambridge Semantics, 2011, [5]) are adopted and expanded to describe relate MOOC course profiles, learner profiles, learning goals, and related skill sets. It enables matching of qualified learner profiles for a job position and/or to identify a set of related MOOC course profiles for some learning goal. The potential employers look for a matching skill set from converged learner profiles through the agency. Each skill for the position goes through a mapping procedure with a corresponding MOOC course profile. After mapping skills to corresponding MOOCs, the framework searches for the converged profiles. The result is the list of learners who match or almost match a given job description. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Certifying MOOC; Course profile; e-Learning; Learner profile; Massive open online course; Ontology; Semantic search",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ardis, M., Henderson, P., Is Software Engineering Ready For MOOCs (2012) Proc of SIGSOFT Notes, p. 15. , Cary, NC.

These academic courses, often still free, lead to the delivery of a certificate of attendance and could soon also deliver a diploma. The MOOC “Stratégies diagnostiques des cancers” will be hosted in autumn 2016 on the platform “France Université Numérique” and will have two levels of learners: students in the field of health and biology and the general public. This MOOC will also be integrated into the teaching program of medical students of Paris Diderot University and Paris 13 University. The educational objective of this MOOC is to convey to all participants an overview of the diagnostic steps of cancers and of the various medical specialties involved in this diagnosis. The second week of the MOOC, entitled “tumor samples, macroscopic and microscopic analysis”, presents the pathology specialty with the technical treatment of tissue or cell samples and the basic elements of the tissue section analysis to get a diagnosis of benign or malignant tumor. After this MOOC, it is planned to assess the impact of this new modality of teaching the pathology specialty or pathology, especially by the general public. © 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS","Cancer; Diagnosis; Internet; Massive open online course (MOOC); Medical education; Teaching","Article; autumn; benign tumor; cancer diagnosis; certification; education program; France; human; malignant neoplastic disease; medical education; medical informatics; medical student; online system; specialization; tissue section; education; Internet; Neoplasms; pathology; teaching; Computer-Assisted Instruction; France; Internet; Neoplasms; Pathology",,,,,,,,,,,,"Pappano, L., The year of the MOOC [Internet] (2012), The New York Times NewYork (NY); Subhi, Y., Andresen, K., Bojsen, S.R., Nilsson, P.M., Konge, L., Massive open online courses are relevant for postgraduate medical training (2014) Dan Med, p. 61; Harder, B., Are MOOCs the future of medical education?

Through interrogating Coursera data and pre-/post-course student experience surveys, we investigated student retention, student experience, changes in attitudes, and changes in knowledge. The course ran for 5 weeks, and 33,501 students signed up, of which 16.4% (n = 5,501) received a Certificate of Achievement, indicating they had completed all assessments within the course. This retention rate is above the industry standard of 10%; however, the value of retention rate as a metric to judge MOOC success is questionable. Instead, we focus on demographics, with Coursera data estimating that 41% of learners came from Europe, 35% from North America, 11% from Asia, 6% from Oceania, 5% from South America, and 2% from Africa. Most learners had completed an undergraduate degree. Despite this wide range of backgrounds, 57.2% of post-course respondents (n = 2,399) strongly agreed that the information presented was at the right level and 64.9% strongly agreed that the course was interesting. After completion, more students (w2[4] = 132.40, p < .001) understood that animal welfare was based on the results of scientific study, and significantly fewer students (w2[4] = 361.32, p < .001) felt health was the most important part of animal welfare. Overall, learners agreed the course was enjoyable and informative, and 97.9% felt the course was a valuable use of their time. We conclude that MOOCs are an appropriate vehicle for providing animal welfare learning to a wide audience, but require a significant level of investment. © 2016 AAVMC.","Animal welfare; Animal welfare education; Online learning; Veterinary education","adolescent; adult; aged; animal; animal welfare; education; female; human; international cooperation; Internet; male; middle aged; organization and management; questionnaire; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Animal Welfare; Animals; Education, Distance; Education, Veterinary; Educational Measurement; Female; Humans; International Cooperation; Internet; Male; Middle Aged; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult",,,,,,,,,,,,"(2011) Foresight.

Using an author-developed survey, learners reported their perceptions on instructional activities and learning gains within the MOOC, as well as their enrolment purposes. Motivations varied with the majority of learners wanting to formulate a viewpoint or to justify their existing viewpoint, with those taking the MOOC in order to earn a formal certification reporting the highest learning gains. Overall, learners perceived lectures and videos as the most impactful instructional strategy. However, learners who reported the personal project activity as the most effective instructional strategy showed the highest learning gain.

The strategy, Copying Answers using Multiple Existences Online (CAMEO), involves a user who gathers solutions to assessment questions using a ""harvester"" account and then submits correct answers using a separate ""master"" account. We use a small-scale experiment to verify CAMEO and estimate a ""lower bound"" for its prevalence among 1.9 million course participants in 115 MOOCs from two universities. Using conservative thresholds, we estimate CAMEO prevalence at 1237 certificates, accounting for 1.3% of the certificates in the 69 MOOCs with CAMEO users. Among earners of 20 or more certificates, 25% have used the CAMEO strategy. CAMEO users are more likely to be young, male, and international than other MOOC certificate earners. We identify preventive strategies that can decrease CAMEO rates and show evidence of their effectiveness in science courses. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We deployed this MOOC three times with a total enrollment of over 100,000 students. If MOOCs are truly going to transform engineering education, then they must be able to deliver classes with laboratory components. Our offering goes a long way in unraveling the perceived complexities in delivering a laboratory experience to thousands of students from around the globe. We believe the techniques developed in this class will significantly transform the MOOC environment. Effective education requires students to learn by doing. In the traditional academic setting this active learning is achieved through a lab component. Translating this to the online environment is a non-trivial task that required several important factors to come together. First, we have significant support from industrial partners ARM Inc. [1] and Texas Instruments [2]. Second, the massive growth of embedded microcontrollers has made the availability of lost-cost development platforms feasible. Third, we have assembled a team with the passion, patience, and experience of delivering quality lab experiences to large classes. Fourth, online tools now exist that allow students to interact and support each other. We used edX for the delivery of videos, interactive animations, text, and quizzes [3]. We used Piazza [4] for discussion boards and Zyante[5] for a programming reference. We partnered with element-14[6], Digi-Key[7], and Mouser[8] to make the lab kit available and low-cost. Even though there was a $40-$70 cost to purchase the lab kit, the course completion numbers were slightly better than a typical MOOC. 7.3% of the students completed enough of the class to receive a certificate. Students completing end of the course surveys report a 95% overall satisfaction. Demographics show a world-wide reach with India, US, and Egypt being the countries with the most students. In this paper we will present best practices, successes and limitations of teaching a substantial lab across the globe. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2016.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"www.arm.com; http://www.ti.com/; https://www.edx.org/; https://piazza.com/; https://zybooks.zyante.com/; A Premier Farnell Company, , www.element14.com/; http://www.digikey.com; A TTI and Berkshire Hathaway Company, , http://www.mouser.com/; White, E., (2012) Making Embedded Systems: Design Patterns for Great Software, , O'Reilly Media Inc; Vahid, F., Givargis, T.D., (2002) Embedded System Design: A Unified Hardware/Software Introduction, , Wiley; Valvano, J., (2015) Embedded Systems: Introduction to ARM Cortex-M Microcontrollers, , Createspace; http://news.stanford.edu/news/2013/december/lab-ina-box-120613.html; http://www.rsc.org/eic/2015/03/mooc-massive-open-online-course; https://www.coursera.org/course/physicalchemistry; https://www.coursera.org/course/hwswinterface; Ferri, B.H., Majerich, D.M., Parrish, N.V., Ferri, A.A., Use of a MOOC platform to blend a linear circuits course for non-majors (2014) Paper Presented at 2014 ASEE Annual Conference, , https://peer.asee.org/23237, June Indianapolis, Indiana; Connor, K.A., Huettel, L., Virtual community of practice: Electric circuits (2014) Paper Presented at 2014 ASEE Annual Conference, , https://peer.asee.org/23292, June Indianapolis, Indiana; Cherner, Y.E., Kukla, M.M., Hobbs, L.W., Vasilev, S.V., Fedorov, I., Sigov, A.S., Use of a virtual multifunctional X-ray diffractometer for teaching science and engineering courses (2014) Paper Presented at 2014 ASEE International Forum, , https://peer.asee.org/17202, June Indianapolis, Indiana; Saterbak, A., Oden, M., Muscarello, A.L., Wettergreen, M., Teaching freshman design using a flipped classroom model (2014) Paper Presented at 2014 ASEE Annual Conference, , https://peer.asee.org/23097, June Indianapolis, Indiana; https://www.coursera.org/learn/iot; https://www.edx.org/course/cyber-physical-systems-uc-berkeleyx-eecs149-1x; Juniwal, G., Jain, S., Donzé, A., Seshia, S.A., Clustering-based active learning for CPSGrader (2015) Proceedings of the Second ACM Conference on Learning@Scale (L@S), , March; http://www.openweathermap.org/api; http://embsysmooc.appspot.com/; http://www.keil.com/appnotes/docs/apnt_154.asp; http://www.keil.com/appnotes/docs/apnt_196.asp; http://www.keil.com/appnotes/docs/apnt_204.asp; http://www.keil.com/appnotes/docs/apnt_176.asp; Bertino, E., Negri, M., Pelagatti, G., Sbattella, L., Object-oriented query languages: The notion and the issues (1992) IEEE Trans. on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 4 (3), pp. 223-236; (2014) Blended Learning, Harvard, MIT: Despite Low Completion Rates, MOOCs Work, , http://hechingerreport.org/harvard-mit-despite-low-completion-rates-moocs-work/; (2015) MOOC Completion Rates: The Data, , http://www.katyjordan.com/MOOCproject.html, June",,,"","American Society for Engineering Education","123rd ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition","26 June 2016 through 29 June 2016",,123120,,,,,"English","ASEE Annu.

Next, five major value propositions for MOOCs are considered (headhunting, certification, face-to-face learning, personalized learning, integration with services external to the MOOC, marketing). Then, four pricing strategies for MOOCs are examined (cross-subsidy, third-party, “freemium”, nonmonetary). Although the MOOC movement has experienced growing pains similar to most innovations, we assert that the unyielding pace of improvements in network technologies combined with the need to tame the costs of higher education will create continuing demand for MOOC offerings. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Assessment; Educational technology; Financing higher education; MOOCs; Online learning; Policy in education",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Shu, C., Coursera Adds Another $20M to Its Already Massive Series B, , http://techcrunch.com/2013/11/23/coursera-adds-another-20m-to-its-already-massive-series-b/, TechCrunch. 23 November 2013, accessed on 20 April 2014; Shah, D., (2016) Moocs in 2015, , https://www.class-central.com/report/moocs-2015-stats/, By the Numbers, Available online, accessed on 27 February; Franklin, B., (1914) Poor Richard’s Almanack (1732 to 1759), , https://ia802302.us.archive.org/20/items/poorrichardsalma00franrich/poorrichardsalma00franrich.pdf, The U.S.C.

The MOOC contains an e-text, simple checkpoint problems and homework. We show how certain course design aspects affect student behaviour: (a) frequent quizzes correlated with students reading a large fraction of the e-text, and (b) When homework sets are arranged by increasing (instructor-estimated) difficulty, we found strong correlations between difficulty and time to solution, but weak correlations with percent correct. Modifications to the second offering of the course resulted in higher retention. These modifications included targeting physics teachers and posting materials well in advance. We define retention as certificates earned relative to participants who make a significant effort on the second assignment. Retention measured this way varied between 44% and 72%, being highest in the course aimed at teachers. We show that there is significant learning among MOOC participants. Applying item response theory to common homework problems showed that the MOOC participants had significantly higher ability than students in a Massachusetts Institute of Technology course and that they maintained this advantage over the duration of the MOOC. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Blended classroom; Item response theory; Learning analytics; MOOC; Online learning; Retention",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Breslow, L., Pritchard, D.E., DeBoer, J., Stump, G., Ho, A., Seaton, D., Studying learning in the worldwide classroom: research into edX's first MOOC (2013) Research & Practice in Assessment, 8, pp. 13-25; Champaign, J., Colvin, K.F., Liu, A., Fredericks, C., Seaton, D., Pritchard, D.E., Correlating skill and improvement in 2 MOOCs with a student's time on tasks (2014) Proceedings of the First ACM Conference on Learning@Scale, pp. 11-20. , New York, NY: Association for Computing Machinery; Christensen, A.G., Steinmetz, A., Alcorn, B., Bennett, A., Woods, D., Emanuel, E.J., (2013), papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2350964, The MOOC phenomenon: Who takes massive open online courses and why?

The Distributed Esteemed Endorser Review (DEER) approach has been developed as an alternative for those MOOCs where traditional approaches to assessment are not appropriate. In DEER, course projects are certified in-person by an ""Esteemed Endorser"", an individual who is typically senior in rank to the student, but is not necessarily an expert in the course content. Not only does DEER provide a means to certify that course goals have been met, it also provides MOOC participants with the opportunity to share information about what they have learned with others at the local level.","Assessment; DEER; Educational robotics; Esteemed Endorser; MOOC; Robot programming","Educational robots; Robot programming; Assessment; DEER; Educational robotics; Esteemed Endorser; MOOC; Curricula",,,,,,"This work was supported by a generous grant from Google CS4HS.",,,,,,"Balfour, S.P., Assessing writing in MOOCs: Automated essay scoring and calibrated peer review (2013) Research & Practice in Assessment, 8 (1), pp. 40-48; College Board, (2015) Become an SAT Essay Reader, , http://professionals.collegeboard.com/profdev/opportunities/become-sat-reader, Accessed October 2015 from; Brooks, M., Basu, S., Jacobs, C., Vanderwende, L., Divide and correct: Using clusters to grade short answers at scale (2014) Proceedings of the First ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale Conference (L@S'14), pp. 89-98. , ACM, New York, NY, USA; Crusan, D., And then a miracle occurs: The use of computers to assess student writing (2015) International Journal of TESOL and Learning, 4 (1), pp. 20-32; Kay, J.S., (2015) Educational Robotics for Absolute Beginners, , http://www.rowan.edu/cs4hs, Accessed October 2015 from; (2013) NCTE Position Statement on Machine Scoring, , http://www.ncte.org/positions/statements/machine_scoring, Retrieved October 2015 from; Sadler, P.M., Good, E., The impact of self- and peer-grading on student learning (2006) Educational Assessment, 11 (1), pp. 1-31; Topping, K., Peer assessment between students in colleges and universities (1998) Review of Educational Research, 68 (3), pp. 249-276; Vogelsang, T., Ruppertz, L., On the validity of peer grading and a cloud teaching assistant system (2015) Proceedings of the Fifth International Conference on Learning Analytics and Knowledge (LAK'15), pp. 41-50. , ACM, New York, NY, USA; Wilkowski, J., Deutsch, A., Russell, D.M., Student skill and goal achievement in the mapping with google MOOC (2014) Proceedings of the First ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale, pp. 3-10",,,"ACM;edX;Google;Instructure, Inc.;Microsoft Research;Oracle Academy","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","3rd Annual ACM Conference on Learning at Scale, L@S 2016","25 April 2016 through 26 April 2016",,121394,,9781450337267,,,"English","LS - Proc.

This paper reports on the relationships between learners' patterns and motives of engagement and their prior subject knowledge with their course performance in the Digital Storytelling MOOC. Results from this study indicate that learners who demonstrated active engagement in the MOOC tended to outperform other learners who did not practice this trait. Learners whose motives for participation involved earning the Continuing Professional Development certificate, gaining skills, ideas and inspirations, and improving their professional practice outperformed the students who valued these traits less. Learners who possessed moderate level of content knowledge seemed to benefit most from the course. This paper contributes insight into aspects of students' behaviors that possibly contributed to their success in a MOOC and invites discussion on how to reinforce these traits. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Using dataset from xuetangX, one of the largest MOOCs from China, we analyze key factors that influence students' engagement in MOOCs and study to what extent we could infer a student's learning effectiveness. We observe significant behavioral heterogeneity in students' course selection as well as their learning patterns. For example, students who exert higher effort and ask more questions are not necessarily more likely to get certificates. Additionally, the probability that a student obtains the course certificate increases dramatically (3× higher) when she has one or more ""certificate friends"". Moreover, we develop a unified model to predict students' learning effectiveness, by incorporating user demographics, forum activities, and learning behavior. We demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms (+2.03-9.03% by F1-score) several alternative methods in predicting students' performance on assignments and course certificates. The model is flexible and can be applied to various settings. For example, we are deploying a new feature into xuetangX to help teachers dynamically optimize the teaching process. © 2016 ACM.","MOOCs; Online engagement; Predictive model; User behavior","Behavioral research; Computer aided instruction; Data mining; Education; Forecasting; Information retrieval; Online systems; Students; Teaching; Websites; World Wide Web; Learning effectiveness; Massive open online course; MOOCs; Online engagement; Online learning environment; Predictive modeling; Students' engagements; User behaviors; E-learning",,,,,,,,,,,,"Agarwal, D., Chen, B.-C., Regression-based latent factor models (2009) KDD'09, pp. 19-28; Anderson, A., Huttenlocher, D., Kleinberg, J., Leskovec, J., Engaging with massive online courses (2014) WWW'14, pp. 687-698; Bastien, F., Lamblin, P., Pascanu, R., Bergstra, J., Goodfellow, I., Bergeron, A., Bouchard, N., Bengio, Y., Theano: New features and speed improvements (2012) Deep Learning and Unsupervised Feature Learning NIPS 2012 Workshop; Bayer, J., Bydzovská, H., Géryk, J., Obsivac, T., Popelinsky, L., Predicting drop-out from social behaviour of students (2012) EDM'12, pp. 103-109; Bergstra, J., Breuleux, O., Bastien, F., Lamblin, P., Pascanu, R., Desjardins, G., Turian, J., Bengio, Y., Theano: A cpu and GPU math expression compiler (2010) SciPy'10, 4, p. 3; Brinton, C.G., Chiang, M., Jain, S., Lam, H., Liu, Z., Wong, F.M.F., Learning about social learning in moocs: From statistical analysis to generative model (2014) IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies, 7 (4), pp. 346-359; Buckley, C., Voorhees, E.M., Retrieval evaluation with incomplete information (2004) SIGIR'04, pp. 25-32; Champaign, J., Colvin, K.F., Liu, A., Fredericks, C., Seaton, D., Pritchard, D.E., Correlating skill and improvement in 2 MOOCs with a student's time on tasks (2014) L@S'14, pp. 11-20; Chaturvedi, S., Goldwasser, D., Daumé, H., III, Predicting instructor's intervention in MOOC forums (2014) ACL'14, pp. 1501-1511; Fan, R.-E., Chang, K.-W., Hsieh, C.-J., Wang, X.-R., Lin, C.-J., LIBLINEAR: A library for large linear classification (2008) JMLR, 9, pp. 1871-1874; Guo, P.J., Reinecke, K., Demographic differences in how students navigate through MOOCs (2014) L@S'14, pp. 21-30; Hershkovitz, A., Baker, R.S., Gowda, S.M., Corbett, A.T., Predicting future learning better using quantitative analysis of moment-by-moment learning (2013) EDM'13, pp. 74-81; Hinton, G.E., Osindero, S., Teh, Y.-W., A fast learning algorithm for deep belief nets (2006) Neural Computation, 18, pp. 1527-1554; Howard, R.A., (1960) Dynamic Programming and Markov Processes, , The M.I.T.

Unlike traditional courses, MOOCs require additional skills, provided by videographers, instructional designers, IT specialists and platform specialists. Over the past few years several Universities facilitated partnership with MOOCs providers and are building MOOC courses, to serve as e-learning versions of their courses. Despite all the advantages offered by the MOOC courses, the current statistics show that only a very limited number of registered learners are completing the course. And the vast majority are stopping learning at an early stage. The main reason can be found in the lack of motivation of the students to pass the exams to become a certificate, because universities do not accept the certificates for credits. The aim of this paper is to study the readiness of students to take MOOC courses on one hand and the acceptance of MOOC courses in Universities. A study is conducted on two Universities, Hasselt University, Belgium and Princess Sumaya University for Technology, Jordan. The results of the study are promising, as they suggest that such virtual study programs are accepted in both Universities. However, professors in both Universities elucidate concerns on accepting the equivalence of the MOOC courses to their own courses. © 2015 IEEE.","adoption of MOOCs; completion of MOOCs; intelligent e-Learning; MOOC; university study programs",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Jasnani, P., Designing moocs (2013) A White Paper on Instructional Design for MOOCs, , http://www.tatainteractive.comlpdf/Designing_MOOCsA_White_Paper_on_lDJor_MOOCs.pdf, Publisher: Tata Interactive Systems; Reilly, C., MOOCs deconstructed: Variables that affect mooc success rates (2013) Proceedings of World Conference on E-Learning in Corporate, pp. 1308-2133. , In T.

Aim: This study was undertaken to evaluate the strength of and the opportunities for implementing evidence-based nursing practice across a diverse 9-hospital system located in the mid-Atlantic region. Methods: A cross-sectional survey of 6,800 registered nurses (RNs), with a 24% response rate, was conducted to learn about their attitudes, beliefs, and perceptions toward organizational readiness and implementation of EBP. Results: Although respondents' beliefs about EBP were positive, they reported their ability to implement EBP as extremely low. More than one third (36%) of the respondents worked at two of the system's Magnet designated hospitals. Magnet RNs reported more resources and held more positive beliefs about their hospital's organizational readiness for EBP. Nurses who possess advanced nursing degrees, certification, and who serve in leadership roles were favorable toward EBP. Younger RNs with fewer years in practice were more likely to have positive beliefs toward EBP and embedding it into the organizational culture. Linking Evidence to Practice: Findings mirror previous research where nurses internationally favor EBP yet struggle with similar barriers for implementation. Strategies to link this evidence to action can be taken at local and global levels. Locally, transformational nurse leaders within each hospital can share the vision for implementing EBP and embrace Magnet principles. At the system level, transformational nurse leaders can collectively allocate resources to create a system-wide online EBP education plan with EBP competencies and tool kit to increase RN exposure to EBP and standardize practice. Globally, promoting free and accessible EBP massive open online courses (MOOC) and sharing best practices online and at international forums such as Magnet conferences will help to lead, educate, and mentor nurses with strategies to systematically increase EBP uptake. © 2016 Sigma Theta Tau International.","Evidence-based practice; Evidence-based practice beliefs; Healthcare system; Hospital system; Magnet hospitals; Nursing; Organizational culture; Organizational readiness; Survey; Workplace environment","adult; cross-sectional study; evidence based nursing; female; health personnel attitude; human; male; middle aged; nurse; organization; psychology; Adult; Attitude of Health Personnel; Cross-Sectional Studies; Evidence-Based Nursing; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Nurses; Organizational Culture",,,,,,,,,,,,"Aarons, G.A., Ehrhart, M.G., Farahnak, L.R., Hurlburt, M.S., Leadership and organizational change for implementation (LOCI): A randomized mixed method pilot study of a leadership and organization development intervention for evidence-based practice implementation (2015) Implementation Science, 10 (1), pp. 1-12; (2015) Fast facts on US hospitals, , http://www.aha.org/research/rc/stat-studies/fast-facts.shtml#system; (2013) 2014 Magnet application manual, , Silver Spring, MD: Author; (2015) History of the Magnet program, , http://www.nursecredentialing.org/magnet/programoverview/historyofthemagnetprogram; Dalheim, A., Harthug, S., Nilsen, R., Nortvedt, M., Factors influencing the development of evidence-based practice among nurses: A self-report survey (2012) BioMed Central Health Services Research, 12 (367), pp. 1-10; Dillman, D., (2007) A mail and internet surveys: The tailored design method: With new internet, visual and mixed-mode guide, , (2nd ed.).

For the purpose of creating another platform for the seafarers to meet and accomplish this requirement, this paper studied the development and implementation of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) in Maritime Education and Training (MET). The approach considered instructional design strategies (ISD) and methodology, target audience, type of training, content, evaluation and assessment schemes. Furthermore, the significant barriers in MET have been discussed including the current issues and challenges faced in the maritime industry. Given these complexities for MOOCs and considering the expected outcomes for both the seafarers and the maritime industry as a whole, the process may seem wearisome. Also, its immediate implementation may negatively impact the expected performance outcomes of the entire system as it currently stands. However, the long term benefits of a properly structured MOOC, being a learning management system (LMS) or e-learning platform, should be seen to overcome this setback and serve its intended purpose effectively.

Reasons for taking these courses vary, such as improving employment prospects, especially in the technology sector, though the impact of these certificates has not been established. Factors identified as barriers to the acceptance of these certifications include user verification issues and a lack of familiarity of MOOC content. There are positive signs in employers recommending MOOCs for training purposes and a major MOOC platform collaborating with companies to provide a work placement scheme. The discussion regarding the value of traditional and online education also applies, as employers are seeking candidates who are technically skilled and ready for work, which is not guaranteed by a traditional degree certificate. This review provides a baseline collation of current opinion and research. Independent qualitative research and further literature review should be conducted to build an evidence base regarding the use of MOOCs and their certificates.","Certificate; Employment; MOOC; Online Education","Distance education; Education; Employment; Personnel training; Certificate; Literature reviews; Massive open online course; MOOC; On-line education; Qualitative research; Technology sectors; User verification; E-learning",,,,,,,,,,,,"Andersen, E., (2014) How Google Picks New Employees (Hint: It's Not about Your Degree), , http://www.forbes.com/sites/erikaandersen/2014/04/07/how-google-picks-new-employees-hint-its-not-about-yourdegree/#5b5734af3f27, Forbes [Accessed 9 May 2016]; Belkin, D., Porter, C., (2013) Job Market Embraces Massive Online Courses, , http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324807704579087840126695698, Wall Street Journal [Accessed 1 May 2016]; Belleflamme, P., Jacqmin, J., An economic appraisal of MOOC platforms: Business models and impacts on higher education (2015) CESifo Economic Studies, p. ifv016; Boeckh, A., (2014) Verified Certificate MOOCs & Suggested Verified MOOCs Academic Pathways by MOOCs University, , http://www.moocs.co/Credits_for_MOOCS__News.html, Global Directory of MOOCs [Accessed 27 April 2016]; Haynie, D., (2015) Opportunity for Credit A New Hook for MOOCs, , http://www.usnews.com/education/online-education/articles/2015/05/27/chance-for-credit-gives-new-life-to-moocs, US News [Accessed 10 May 2016]; Jordan, K., Initial trends in enrolment and completion of massive open online courses (2014) The International Review of Research in Open and Distributed Learning, 15 (1); Kirsner, S., (2013) Will MOOCs Help You Open Career Doors?, , https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2013/10/05/will-mooc-help-you-open-careerdoors/pmjHbLCghsH0lEbulWC9VL/story.html, Boston Globe [Accessed 27 April 2016]; Koller, D., (2015) The Hype Is Dead but MOOCs Are Marching on, , http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/moocs-making-progress-hype-died/, Knowledge@Wharton University of Pennsylvania [Accessed April 27 2016]; Krumrie, M., (2014) Should Employers Take Massive Open Online Courses Seriously?, , https://www.ziprecruiter.com/blog/do-employers-take-massive-open-online-courses-seriously/, Zip Recruiter [Accessed 27 April 2016]; Larson, S., (2013) Can An Online Education Actually Land You A Job?, , http://readwrite.com/2013/12/13/mooc-online-education-jobs/, readwrite [Accessed 27 April 2016]; Ma, X., Evaluating the implication of open badges in an open learning environment to higher education (2015) 2015 International Conference on Education Reform and Modern Management, , Atlantis Press; Ng, T.H., (2016) Do Employers Find MOOCs Certificates from Coursera or EdX Valuable?, , https://www.quora.com/Do-employers-find-MOOCs-certificates-from-Coursera-or-edX-valuable, Quora [Accessed 27 April 2016]; (2015) Improvement FUNdamentals - Your Route to Improve Health and Care!, , http://www.nhsiq.nhs.uk/capacity-capability/improvement-fundamentals.aspx, NHS Improving Quality.

Video lectures and in-video learning activities are elements that distinctively differs MOOCs from other online courses. Hence, the recording and production process of these video lectures, along with insertion of learning activities are important to produce an efficient MOOC course and sustaining learners engagement. Furthermore, segmenting technics and structuring the course are other elements to consider in designing the course. Alongside, instructors are stimulated to think of new ways to adapt to the change in the learning needs of learners. Designing MOOCs as microcourses, team teaching, changing the roles of lecturers and students, utilizing existing materials, and OERs in MOOCs are some of the ideas and concepts to be considered.

There are no requirements to register and for those not wishing to receive course credit or a certificate indicating successful completion, there are no charges to enroll. As a result, enrollments can reach into the thousands. MOOCs are a recent twenty-first century phenomenon that emerged from the open educational resources movement and a course entitled “Connectivism and Connective Knowledge” offered in 2008 by George Siemens and Stephen Downes. There were a small number of students at the University of Manitoba who paid tuition and several thousand others who simply participated in the online course environment at no cost. Given the subject (connectivism) of that early MOOC and the fact that those not paying were there as part of an extended community gathered around the subject of the course, it is reasonable to conclude that the ‘C’ in MOOC stood for ‘course’ for registered participants and ‘community’ for those not registered. Since 2008, MOOCs have appeared in many places and have taken many forms. This chapter examines the growth of MOOCs and the roles that they can play in the context of learning and instruction. The argument herein is that it is a mistake to consider current MOOCs to be a new form of a distance learning course. Rather, current MOOCs should be viewed and evaluated not as courses but as communities of subject-specific participants. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2017.","Distance education; Dynamic feedback; Formative feedback; MOOCS",,,,,,"Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, BMGF; Athabasca University, AU","According to recent sources (see, for example, http://ecolearning.eu/ectsmooc/) there are 4000 or more MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) being offered in 2015.

The IITBombayX course, Basic 3D animation using Blender (SKANI101x), was the first of its kind offering of a Skill Development MOOC (sdMOOC) for the Indian learners. Over its two offerings, 6457 participants registered, 2465 (38%) were active and 1132 (19%) were certified. However while producing and conducting the course we realized the lack of content creation and pedagogic strategies for such sdMOOCs. Analysis of our pilot offering of SKANI101x, highlighted its effectiveness for both, first-time and experienced online learners. In the second offering we modified pedagogic strategies to foster student-instructor interactions that resulted in higher engagement and completion rate. This paper discusses the rationale of the decisions and reports an evaluation study of participants' performance, engagement, and perceptions regarding the components of the course over two offerings. This provides an evidence for the effectiveness of the content creation and pedagogic strategies implemented.","3D animation skill development; Content creation for MOOCs; IITBombayX; Pedagogic strategies for skill development MOOCs; SKANI101x; Skill development MOOCs","Animation; Blending; Planning; Teaching; 3D animation; Content creation; Evaluation study; IITBombayX; SKANI101x; Skill development; Student-instructor interactions; Curricula",,,,,,,,,,,,"Bali, M., MOOC pedagogy: Gleaning good practice from existing MOOCs (2014) Journal of Online Learning and Teaching, 10 (1), p. 44; Conole, G.G., MOOCs as disruptive technologies: Strategies for enhancing the learner experience and quality of MOOCs (2015) Revista de Educación a Distancia, (39); Gaebel, M., (2014) MOOCs: Massive Open Online Courses, , EUA; Glance, D.G., Forsey, M., Riley, M., The pedagogical foundations of massive open online courses (2013) First Monday, 18 (5); Hirata, Y., (2013) The Condition of Indian Animation Industries between Global Economy and Local Culture; Holotescu, C., Grosseck, G., Cretu, V., Naaji, A., Integrating MOOCs in blended courses (2014) The International Scientific Conference ELearning and Software for Education, 4, p. 243. , October"", Carol I"" National Defence University; Kannan, K., Narayanan, K., Model and learner feedback for a large scale technology enabled teacher training program (2011) IEEE Int.

The potential benefits are particularly of paramount importance in developing countries such as India due to paucity of good faculty with regards to scaling up of professional education. India has now officially jumped into the open online courses bandwagon with the government announcing many initiatives with an objective of providing affordable and quality education to all desirous. IITBombayX is one such online platform which offers interactive online classes and MOOCs for faculty professional development. This paper reports findings from MOOC on ET601Tx that were instrumental in 98.6% course completion rate conducted at our institute against a general 24% for this course at all over India. Out of the 146 registered, 144 went on to complete the entire course and received honor code certificates. The post MOOC survey of 133 participants revealed that 'Institutional Leadership' in the form of Coordinated Faculty Professional Development Activity (CFPDA) was a major contributing factor in making the faculty persists throughout the course and completing it successfully. The CFPDA at the institution, in the form of review meetings facilitation by education technology mentors, department coordinators has led to 98.6 % persistence and higher scores obtained by the faculty participants.","Completion rate; Coordinated professional development activity; Education technology; ET601Tx; Institutional Leadership; MOOCs; Persistence","Curricula; Developing countries; Education; Professional aspects; Surveys; Teaching; Education technology; ET601Tx; Institutional Leadership; MOOCs; Persistence; Professional development; E-learning",,,,,,,,,,,,"Adamopoulos, P., What makes a great MOOC?

MOOCs are a new way to design and deliver online learning. Learners become part of an on-line community where they can participate as reviewers, collaborate with each other and are engaged in watching videos and other multimedia resources. However, MOOCs are also generating a huge debate around three different aspects: the learning process including evaluation and certification criteria, the lack of skills among instructors to design and plan MOOCs and the technicaland security issues of MOOC platforms. More specifically, institutions are currently making a great effort to become part of main facilitators' platforms. They are creating a good number of methodologies, guidelines and best practices to equip instructors with the necessary skills to produce high-quality learning resources that can encourage learners' participation and decrease the dropout rate. On the other hand, engineering education is one of the main a reas of interest in MOOC courses. In the software and computer engineering area it is possible to find a huge number of MOOC sinparticular topics ranging from an introductory to a master level. How ever, just a few courses address a holistic view of a domain such as software engineering due to the intrinsic difficulty of summarizingin a few weeks the main concepts of anengineering discipline. That is why, in this paper, authors introduce an Agile MOOC Development Lifecycle (AMDL) to address the challenge of designing a MOOC from scratch. Afterwards, the framework is applied to create aMOOC course about software engineering for a non-technical audience and developed by a large and multidisciplinary team of 18 instructors. This experience is also reported as a case study to validate the proposed development lifecycle. Finally, some discussion, lessons learned and future research lines are also outlined. © 2016 TEMPUS Publications.","Agile; E-learning; MOOC; On-line education; Software engineering","Education; Engineering education; Learning systems; Life cycle; Multimedia systems; Software engineering; Agile; Computer engineering; Massive open online course; MOOC; Multi-disciplinary teams; Multimedia resources; On-line communities; On-line education; E-learning",,,,,,,,,,,,"Christensen, G., Steinmetz, A., Alcorn, B., Bennett, A., Woods, D., Emanuel, E.J., The MOOC phenomenon: Who takes massive open online courses and why?

Design: A MOOC titled “Special Topics in Clinical Pharmacy” for pharmacists as a professional continue education program was developed and evaluated. It was implemented with case-based lecture videos and interactive quizzes. Content was delivered in weekly base. A Pre-course survey, a post-course survey, and a learner-driven final assessment were conducted accordingly. Results: The primary outcomes of the MOOCs in effectively engaging learners and motivating targeted learners from massive online learner were assessed. The satisfactory of MOOCs production from learners was evaluated as well. There were 407 participants signed in for this MOOC. 95% of certificate earners were pharmacists. 88% were willing to take the next professional MOOC. MOOCs might be an innovative, effective and efficient approach to deliver professional continue education. The study also shows that more efforts on implementing online communities should be made to engage more learners. © 2016, Association of Pharmaceutical Teachers of India.

A minimum of 15 credit hours of CME per year for general practitioners and 30 credit hours for specialist doctors have been made mandatory for renewal of the PMDC registration. While doctors can attend conferences to earn this CME credit, the opportunities are minimum and limited to major cities across Pakistan. Webbased CME is an attractive alternative to attending conferences. It can make up for 25% of the yearly PMDC requirement. So far, only two web-based CME providers have been launched in Pakistan, which is a shortage. Could Massive Online Open Courses (MOOCs) be used to fill this shortage? The MOOCs are online courses that are easily accessible to all learners irrespective of geographical boundary and resources, and can be used as a tool to provide CME to physicians. The problem as to how credit from PM&DC can be obtained, will need to be explored further.","Continuing medical education (CME); eLearning; Massive online open courses (MOOCs); Online education; Pakistan medical and dental council (PM&DC)","city; general practitioner; human; human experiment; medical education; Pakistan; registration; tooth; accreditation; adult; certification; clinical competence; education; female; Internet; male; medical education; middle aged; online system; procedures; utilization; Accreditation; Adult; Certification; Clinical Competence; Education, Medical, Continuing; Educational Measurement; Female; Humans; Internet; Male; Middle Aged; Online Systems; Pakistan; Physicians, Family",,,,,,,,,,,,"CME notification [Internet] (2015), http://cfmp.org.pk/pmdc-cme-notification/; CME notification [Internet] (2015), http://cfmp.org.pk/list-ofinstitutions-have-been-accreditated-by-pmdc-to-awardcmecde-certification/; Liyanagunawardena, T.R., Williams, S.A., Massive open online courses on health and medicine: review (2014) J Med Internet Res, 16; Introduction [Internet] (2015), http://cfmp.org.pk/; E-CME Program [Internet] (2015), http://lms.duhscme.com/; Jooma, R., Short report proposals for a scheme for continuing professional development in Pakistan (2011) J Pak Med Assoc, 61, pp. 1231-1233; Subhi, Y., Andresen, K., Bojsen, S.R., Nilsson, P.M., Konge, L., Massive open online courses are relevant for postgraduate medical training (2014) Dan Med J, 61, pp. 1-5; Harder, B., BMJ Careers - Are MOOCs the future of medical education?

Using data from 68 MOOCs offered by Harvard and MIT between 2012 and 2014,we found that course participants fromthe United States tended to live in more-affluent and better-educated neighborhoods than the average U.S. resident. Among those who did register for courses, students with greater socioeconomic resources were more likely to earn a certificate. Furthermore, these differences inMOOCaccess and completionwere larger for adolescents and young adults, the traditional ages where people find on-ramps into science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) coursework and careers.

However, it was not until 2008 that Dave Cormier actually explicitly used the term MOOC for a Massive Open Online Course (Daniel, 2012; Downes, 2012a; Watters, 2012). Downes(2012b) subsequently argued that MOOCs enable large numbers of people to combine the advantages of open content and open learning for learning, training and personal development. This educational model attempts to promote learning for a large number of people with a shared interest, by removing initial limits of access and attendance, and in some cases, offer credits and/or certificates at very lowcost at the end of the course. It is not surprising, therefore, that despite the conflict of interests with theobjectives of formal educational institutions and the many criticisms raised in the literature (Jackson,2013), MOOCs are having a significant impact upon the online educational community, with hundreds of thousands of people undertaking these courses. They have grabbed the public spotlight and been hailed as an ""educational phenomenon"" (Pappano, 2012). 2012 was called ""the Year of the MOOC"" by the New York Times because, arguably, ""the time was right"" for them to appear.

Since they offer costless learning experiences, many have seen them as a way of reducing the costs of higher education. A commonly suggested approach is that learners should be able to take a range of MOOCsand use their certificates of completion to assemble a portfolio that reflects their learning accomplishments, with separate educational market-providers offering services such as advisement, assessment, and accreditation of the portfolio content. It is speculated that this fracturing, or disaggregation, of the current higher educating system would allow learners greater choice and reduce the costs of obtaining accredited degrees. This chapter explores the opportunities and challenges presented by MOOCs and the economic and educational implications of a proposed disaggregation of the higher education system. The analysis suggests that disaggregation would not necessarily reduced costs, but that it would inevitably destroy much of the unpaid-for-value that resides for graduates in the current aggregated system of higher education. ©2015, IGI Global.",,"Commerce; Cost benefit analysis; Cost reduction; Costs; Learning systems; Disaggregation; Higher education; Higher education system; Learning experiences; Massive open online course; Reduced cost; Education",,,,,,,,,,,,"Allen, I.E., Seaman, J., Grade change: Tracking online education in the United States (2014), http://www.onlinelearningsurvey.com/reports/gradechange.pdf, San Francisco, CA: Babson Survey Research Group and Quahog Research Group; (2008) Reversing course: The troubled state of academic staffing and a path forward, , http://www.aft.org/pdfs/highered/reversingcourse1008.pdf, American Federation of Teachers (AFT) Washington, DC: Author; (2009) American academic: The state of higher education workforce 1997-2007, , http://www.aft.org/pdfs/highered/aa_highedworkforce0209.pdf, American Federation of Teachers (AFT) Washington, DC: Author; (2010) American academic: A national survey of part-time/ adjunct faculty, , http://www.aft.org/pdfs/highered/aa_partimefaculty0310.pdf, American Federation of Teachers (AFT) Washington, DC: Author; Anderson, T., Promise and/or peril: MOOCs and open and distance education (2013) The Commonwealth of Learning, , http://www.col.org/SiteCollectionDocuments/MOOCsPromise-Peril_Anderson.pdf; Archibald, R.B., Feldman, D.H., Why does college cost so much (2010), UK: Oxford University Press; Archibald, R.B., Feldman, D.H., The anatomy of college tuition, , http://www.acenet.edu/news-room/Documents/Anatomy-of-College-Tuition.pdf, Washington, DC: American Council on Education; (2013) More than MOOCs: Opportunities arising from disruptive technologies in education, , http://www.austrade.gov.au/Education/News/Reports/More-than-MOOCs--Opportunities-arising-from-disruptive-technologies-in-education, Austrade (Australian Trade Commission); Baggaley, J., MOOC rampant (2013) Distance Education, 34 (3), pp. 368-378; Barber, M., Donnelly, K., Rizvi, S., (2013) An avalanche is coming: Higher education and the revolution ahead., , http://www.ippr.org/assets/media/images/media/files/publication/2013/04/avalanche-is-coming_Mar2013_10432.pdf, London, UK: Institute for Public Policy Research(IPPR); Bayne, S., Ross, J., (2013) The pedagogy of the massive open online course (MOOC): The UK View, , http://www.heacademy.ac.uk/resources/detail/elt/the_pedagogy_of_the_MOOC_UK_view, London, UK: The Higher Education Academy (HEA); Becker, G.S., (1996) Accounting for tastes, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; Bonk, C.J., Khoo, E., (2014) Adding some TEC-VARIETY: 100+ activities for motivating and retaining learners online., , http://tec-variety.com/TEC-Variety_eBook_5-4.pdf, Bloomington, IN: Open World Books; Boyer, E., Scholarship reconsidered: Priorities of the professoriate (1990), Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press/ Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching; Brabon, B.A., Massive misalignment: the challenge of designing and accrediting MOOCs (2014) Talking about Quality, 8, pp. 1-10. , http://www.qaa.ac.uk/Publications/InformationAndGuidance/Documents/MOOCs-Brabon.pdf; Browne, J., Securing a sustainable future for higher education: An independent review of higher education funding and student finance (2010) Independent Report of the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, , https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/31999/10-1208-securing-sustainable-higher-education-browne-report.pdf, London, UK: BIS; Butcher, N., (2011) A basic guide to open educational resources (OER) [Edited by A.

Massive open online courses (MOOCs) provide an opportunity to expand access to postsecondary and adult education. This chapter explores access, retention, and recognition issues in relation to MOOCs. It argues that formal education models of curriculum design need to be refined to take advantage of the massive open online space. It concludes by describing a conceptual model that proposes an integrative learning analytics approach to support student retention and achievement. © 2016, IGI Global.

Despite the disruptive changes driven by open publishing in scholarly communication, it is challenging to develop widely accepted methods for quality assessment and certification. Similar challenges exist in open education platforms like the massive open online course (MOOC). This work reviews four types of innovations in open publishing in terms of quality control, namely ""light touch"" peer review, post-publication assessment, social peer review, and open peer review. Synthesising the principles and strategies of these innovations, it discusses how they might be inspiring for developing solutions and models for MOOC assessment and credentialing. This chapter concludes by suggesting future research directions. It argues that the open initiatives are co-evolving with the ""traditional"" systems and integrating with the established models. © 2016, IGI Global.

Although this phenomenon is new, the literature on e-assessment suggests a direction based on a knowledge base derived from research into the support needs of the participants’ learning. Together with assessment, participant satisfaction with MOOCs takes on a special role when we consider the interest of the courses and their high drop-out rate. We have two objectives in this paper; on one hand, we analyze the assessment processes in 87 MOOCs developed on different international platforms (Coursera, Udacity, MiríadaX, EdX, and RedunX) at Spanish universities (AbiertaUGR, UPVX, UniMOOC, UnedComa, and Ehusfera) and others; while on the other hand, we reflect on these processes assisted by the study of the MOOCs developed at the University of Granada (Spain). We describe the results classified according to: what is assessed, who performs the assessment, time at which assessment occurs, instruments employed, type of assessment, and type of the certification (participation/accreditation). We study the satisfaction of 513 participants in courses of the first edition offered by AbiertaUGR in 2013.

Despite these factors, the flexible learning offered by a MOOC has the potential to provide an accessible educational environment for a broad spectrum of participants. In this regard, the Wicking Dementia Research and Education Centre has developed a MOOC on dementia that is evidence-based and intended to address this emerging major global public health issue by providing educational resources to a broad range of caregivers, people with dementia, and health care professionals. Methods: The Understanding Dementia MOOC was designed specifically to appeal to, and support, adult learners with a limited educational background. The nine-week course was presented in three units. Participants passed a quiz at the end of each unit to continue through the course. A series of discussion boards facilitated peer-to-peer interactions. A separate ""Ask an Expert"" discussion board also was established for each unit where participants posted questions and faculty with expertise in the area responded. Results: Almost 10,000 people from 65 countries registered; 4,409 registrants engaged in the discussion boards, and 3,624 (38%) completed the course. Participants' level of education ranged from postgraduate study to a primary (elementary) school education. Participants without a university education (vocational certificate and below) were as likely as those with a university education to complete the course (χ2=2.35, df=6, p=0.88) and to engage in the online discussions (F[6, 3799]=0.85, p=0.54). Further, participants who completed the MOOC engaged in significantly more discussion board posts than participants who did not complete the course (t=39.60, df=4407, p &lt;0.001). Conclusions: The high completion rate and level of engagement of participants across a broad spectrum of levels of education suggest that MOOCs can be successfully developed and delivered to students from diverse educational backgrounds. The high participation rate also highlights the combination of MOOC design as well as the scale of unmet need for quality dementia education. © 2015 Goldberg et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","Dementia; Engagement; Level of education; MOOC; Online learning","adult; analysis of variance; attitude to health; Australia; clinical trial; comparative study; dementia; education; educational status; evaluation study; female; health education; human; Internet; male; multicenter study; organization and management; pathophysiology; patient education; procedures; program evaluation; public relations; risk assessment; statistics and numerical data; utilization; vocational education; Adult; Analysis of Variance; Australia; Dementia; Education, Distance; Education, Professional; Educational Measurement; Educational Status; Female; Health Education; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Internet; Interprofessional Relations; Male; Patient Education as Topic; Program Evaluation; Risk Assessment",,,,,,"This study was supported with funding from the JO and JR Wicking Trust.

In 2013, HarvardX offered two ""runs"" of the HeroesX course: In the first, content was released weekly over four months; in the second, all content was released at once. We develop three operationalizations of ""ontrackness"" to measure how students participated in sync with the recommended syllabus. Ontrackness in both versions was low, though in the second, mean ontrackness was approximately one-half of levels in the first HeroesX. We find few differences in persistence, participation, and completion between the two runs. Controlling for a students' number of active weeks, we estimate modest positive effects of ontrackness on certification. The revealed preferences of students for flexibility and the minimal benefits of ontrackness suggest that releasing content all at once may be a viable strategy for MOOC designers.

In the autumn of 2013, Peking University released its first six courses on the Coursera platform. Through mining and analyzing the massive data of learning behavior of over 80000 participants from the courses, this paper endeavors to manifest more than one side of learning activity in MOOC. Meanwhile, according to the characteristic of learning behavior in Chinese MOOC, learners are classified into several groups and then the relationship between their learning behavior and performance is thoroughly studied. Based on the above work, we find out that learners' performance, regarding whether he/she could get certificated eventually, can be predicted by looking into several features of their learning behavior. Experiment results indicate that these features can be trained to effectively estimate whether a learner is probably to complete the course successfully.

However, current MOOC creators cannot provide an effective, economical, and scalable method to detect cheating on tests, which would be required for any certification. In this paper, we propose a Massive Open Online Proctoring (MOOP) framework, which combines both automatic and collab-orative approaches to detect cheating behaviors in on-line tests. The MOOP framework consists of three ma-jor components: Automatic Cheating Detector (ACD), Peer Cheating Detector (PCD), and Final Review Com-mittee (FRC). ACD uses webcam video or other sensors to monitor students and automatically ag suspected cheating behavior. Ambiguous cases are then sent to the PCD, where students peer-review agged webcam video to confirm suspicious cheating behaviors. Finally, the list of suspicious cheating behaviors is sent to the FRC to make the final punishing decision. Our experiment show that ACD and PCD can detect usage of a cheat sheet with good accuracy and can reduce the overall hu-man resources required to monitor MOOCs for cheating. © 2015 ACM.","Cheating Detection; Crowdsourcing; Education; Human Computer Interaction; Machine Learning; MOOC","Artificial intelligence; Computer supported cooperative work; Crowdsourcing; Education; Groupware; Interactive computer systems; Learning systems; Scalability; Students; Cheating detection; High quality; Massive open online course; MOOC; On-line tests; Peer review; Scalable methods; Human computer interaction",,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: IIS-1124240, IIS-12511827","This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. IIS-12511827 and Grant No. IIS-1124240.",,,,,,"ProctorU, , http://www.proctoru.com/; ProctorU: Overview and Technology Requirements, , http://www.ao.uiuc.edu/support/source/student_services/proctoru_tech.html; THE TRIBUNAL, , http://na.leagueoflegends.com/tribunal/; Aggarwal, J., Ryoo, M.S., Human activity analysis: A review, ACM (2011) Computing Surveys (CSUR, 43 (3), p. 16; Case, R., Cabalka, P., Remote proctoring: Results of a pilot program at western governors university (2010) Proceedings of the 25th Annual Conference on Distance Teaching and Learning 10 2009; Dick, M., Sheard, J., Bareiss, C., Carter, J., Joyce, D., Harding, T., Laxer, C., Addressing student cheating: Denitions and solutions (2002) Working Group Reports from ITiCSE on Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education, ITiCSE-WGR '02, ACM (New York, NY, USA, pp. 172-184; Eisenberg, A., (2013) Keeping An Eye on Online Test-Takers, , The New York Times; Jiang, Y.-G., Dai, Q., Xue, X., Liu, W., Ngo, C.-W., Trajectory-based modeling of human actions with motion reference points (2012) Computer Vision-ECCV 2012, pp. 425-438. , Springer; Matikainen, P., Hebert, M., Sukthankar, R., Trajectons: Action recognition through the motion analysis of tracked features (2009) Computer Vision Workshops (ICCV Workshops 2009 IEEE 12th International Conference On, IEEE, pp. 514-521; Mostow, J., Chang, K.-M., Nelson, J., Toward exploiting EEG input in a reading tutor (2011) Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education, AIED'11, Springer, pp. 230-237. , Verlag (Berlin, Heidelberg; Pappano, L., (2012) The Year of the MOOC, , The New York Times; Prince, D.J., Fulton, R.A., Garsombke, T.W., Comparisons of proctored versus non-proctored testing strategies in graduate distance education curriculum (2009) Journal of College Teaching & Learning, 6, p. 7; Richardson, R., North, M., Strengthening the trust in online courses: A common sense approach (2013) J.

These open courses typically offer some form of recognition, such as a certificate of completion and/or digital badge, to recognize, validate, and in some cases even accredit learning. A general problem with MOOCs is the uncertainty regarding the use and goals of recognition, validation, and accreditation (RVA), and participants' acceptance and perception of such techniques. This research effort addresses this problem by exploring course participants' attitudes and levels of acceptance of non-formal learning recognition compared to traditional university credit in both developed and developing countries. The actual study uses both certificates of completion and digital badges to recognize and validate learning in an introductory, university level course in web programming using HTML5/CSS. The course is available to anyone, but was specifically marketed to participants from Sweden and Kenya. Empirical data was gathered using interviews and online surveys in the course. The preliminary results are that participants from developing countries value digital recognition to a greater extent than their counterparts in Europe. However, both Swedes and Kenyans see open courses with digital recognition as a complement to traditional learning to individually construct an education. © 2014 IEEE.","digital badges; learning recognition; MOOCs; non-formal learning","Accreditation; Curricula; Developing countries; Education; Social networking (online); digital badges; Digital recognition; learning recognition; Massive open online course; MOOCs; Non-formal learning; Traditional learning; Traditional universities; E-learning",,,,,,,,,,,,"Bass, R., Disrupting ourselves: The problem of learning in higher education (2012) EDUCAUSE Review, 47 (2); Flavin, M., Disruptive technologies in higher education (2012) Research in Learning Technology, 20. , Aug; Marshall, S.J., Evaluating the strategic and leadership challenges of moocs (2013) Journal of Online Learning & Teaching, 9 (2), p. 216. , Jun; Krause, S., After the invasion: What's next for moocs?

In our complete model, which contains both developing and developed countries, we observe that two country-level variables; internet bandwidth and Hofstede's uncertainty avoidance cultural dimension are positively associated with the probability of getting certified in MOOC environment. We also observe that age, gender, education level and the institution attended are significantly associated with the probability of getting certified in MOOC environment.

In addition, numerous gaps remain in the research literature, particularly concerning predictors of retention and achievement. In this study, we used survival analysis to examine the degree to which student characteristics, relevance, prior experience with MOOCs, self-reported commitment, and learners’ implicit theory of intelligence predicted retention and achievement. We found that learners’ expected investment, including level of commitment, expected number of hours devoted to the MOOC, and intention to obtain a certificate, related to retention likelihood. Prior level of schooling and expected hours devoted to the MOOC predicted achievement. © 2015, © 2015 AERA.","academic achievement; implicit theory of intelligence; MOOCs; motivation; retention",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Adamopoulous, P., (2013) What makes a great MOOC?

Data collection included a 25-item survey of 1,429 newsletter subscribers; 613 of whom also completed an additional 15 open-ended survey items. The 25 close-ended survey findings indicated that respondents used a wide range of devices and places to learn for their self-directed learning needs. Key motivational factors included curiosity, interest, and internal need for self-improvement. Factors leading to success or personal change included freedom to learn, resource abundance, choice, control, and fun. In terms of achievements, respondents were learning both specific skills as well as more general skills that help them advance in their careers. Science, math, and foreign language skills were the most desired by the survey respondents. The key obstacles or challenges faced were time, lack of high quality open resources, and membership or technology fees. Several brief stories of life change across different age ranges are documented. Among the chief implications is that learning something new to enhance one's life or to help others is often more important than course transcript credit or a certificate of completion.","Informal learning; Massive open online courses (MOOCs); Motivation; Open education; Opencourseware; Self-directed learning",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bonk, C.J., The wide open learning world: Sea, land, and ice views (2009) Association for Learning Technology (ALT) Online Newsletter, (17). , http://archive.alt.ac.uk/newsletter.alt.ac.uk/newsletter.alt.ac.uk/1h7kpy8fa5s.html, October 19, Retrieved from; Brant, S., Former MIT president Charles M.

In the context of over 20 years of online learning research, we discuss lessons to be learned from observational comparisons and experiments on randomly chosen groups of students. We target two MOOCs for our study. We investigate dropout rates and how students who decide to drop out differ from those who continue courses. We discuss class forums and video lectures and how these interactions correlate with achievement. We explore the strong correlation between procrastination and achievement and implications for MOOC design. We examine the role of certifications offered by MOOCs and how different options can affect outcomes. We also examine the potential of linking data across courses. We discuss survey data in the context of these MOOCs. These research opportunities offer big data challenges, which are addressed with parallel computing techniques. © 2015, © 2015 Open and Distance Learning Association of Australia, Inc.","achievement; big data subject classification code I21; effort; MOOCs; online education; procrastination; subject classification code I23",,,,,,"Jefferson Trust","We are grateful to Sarah Turner, Leora Friedberg, Kristin Palmer, Eli Bildner, Chuong Do, Jacalyn Huband, Katherine Holcomb, Dan Spitzner, Jeff Holt, and the comments received at the Coursera Partners’ Conference.

With nearly 24,000 enrolled as of early 2015, it is the largest astronomy MOOC available. The astronomical numbers enrolled do not translate into a similar level of engagement. The content consists of 14 hours of video lecture, nearly 1,000 Powerpoint slides, 250 pages of background readings, and 20 podcast interviews with leading researchers. Perhaps in part because of the large amount of course content, the overall completion rate is low, about 3%. However, this number was four times higher for an early cohort of learners who were selected to have a prior interest in astronomy and who took the class in synchronous mode, with new content being added every week. Completion correlates with engagement as measured by posts to the online discussion board. For a subset of learners, social media like Facebook and Twitter provide an additional, important mode of engagement. For the asynchronous learners who have continuously enrolled for the past 15 months, those who complete the course do so quickly, with few persisting longer than two months. The availability of a free completion certificate had no impact on completion rates when it was added midway through the period of data analyzed in this paper. This experiment informs a new offering of an enhanced version of this MOOC via Coursera, along with a co-convened ""flipped"" introductory astronomy class at the University of Arizona, where the video lectures will be online and class time will be used exclusively for small group labs and hands-on activities. Despite their typically low completion rates, MOOCs have the potential to add significantly to public engagement with science, and they attract a worldwide audience. © Impey, Wenger, and Austin.","Astronomy; Astronomy education; Distance education; Education; MOOC; Online education; Online learning; Science; Science education",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Adamopoulos, P., (2013), pp. 1-21. , What makes a great MOOC?

Design: A multicentre, cross-sectional study using a web-based, pilot-tested and self-administered questionnaire. Settings: Ten out of 19 randomly selected medical schools in Egypt. Participants: 2700 undergraduate medical students were randomly selected, with an equal allocation of participants in each university and each study year. Primary and secondary outcome measures: Primary outcome measures were the percentages of students who knew about MOOCs, students who enrolled and students who obtained a certificate. Secondary outcome measures included the limitations and satisfaction of using MOOCs through five-point Likert scale questions. Results: Of 2527 eligible students, 2106 completed the questionnaire (response rate 83.3%). Of these students, 456 (21.7%) knew the term MOOCs or websites providing these courses. Out of the latter, 136 (29.8%) students had enrolled in at least one course, but only 25 (18.4%) had completed courses earning certificates. Clinical year students showed significantly higher rates of knowledge (p=0.009) and enrolment (p<0.001) than academic year students. The primary reasons for the failure of completion of courses included lack of time (105; 77.2%) and slow Internet speed (73; 53.7%). Regarding the 25 students who completed courses, 21 (84%) were satisfied with the overall experience. However, there was less satisfaction regarding student- instructor (8; 32%) and student-student (5; 20%) interactions. Conclusions: About one-fifth of Egyptian medical undergraduates have heard about MOOCs with only about 6.5% actively enrolled in courses. Students who actively participated showed a positive attitude towards the experience, but better time-management skills and faster Internet connection speeds are required. Further studies are needed to survey the enrolled students for a better understanding of their experience.",,"Article; awareness; certification; controlled study; cross-sectional study; developing country; Egypt; female; human; Internet; Likert scale; male; massive open online course; medical education; medical student; online system; outcome assessment; professional knowledge; public relations; structured questionnaire; student satisfaction; time; undergraduate student; adult; attitude; clinical trial; curriculum; developing country; information processing; Internet; medical school; multicenter study; perception; questionnaire; Adult; Attitude; Cross-Sectional Studies; Curriculum; Data Collection; Developing Countries; Egypt; Female; Humans; Internet; Male; Perception; Schools, Medical; Students, Medical; Surveys and Questionnaires",,,,,,,,,,,,"Gooding, I., Klaas, B., Yager, J.D., Massive open online courses in public health (2013) Front Public Health, p. 1; Hoy, M.B., MOOCs 101: An introduction to massive open online courses (2014) Med Ref Serv Q, 33, pp. 85-91; Pappano, L., The year of the MOOC (2013) The New York Times; Triple Milestone, A., 107 partners, 532 courses, 5.2 million students and counting!

Measures for evaluation of success at the institutional level can be derived from institutional goals for open online courses. Success from the point of view of teachers and technical teams involved in design, development and delivery of open online courses can be derived from team members’ expectations, resources and satisfaction as well as measures of cost and effort compared to budget and benchmarks. Users are classified as registrants (information seekers, window shoppers, samplers), downloaders and participants (starters, partial participants and full participants who are further divided into auditing, active and certificate takers); different measures are appropriate for each group.Practical implications – Practitioners and researchers must consider a variety of levels and indicators of success to adequately evaluate open online courses. Tables in the text propose measures, methods, timing and roles.Originality/value – This is the first published paper to take a holistic view of open online course evaluation and propose detailed measures. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","e-Learning; Evaluation; MOOCs; Open online courses; SOOCs; Success measures",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Baker, R., Evans, B., Greenberg, D., Understanding persistence in MOOCs (Massive open online courses): Descriptive and experimental evidence (2014) EMOOCs 2014, European MOOCs Stakeholders Summit, Conference 10-12 February 2014, Lausanne, Switzerland, pp. 5-10. , Cress, U. and Delgado Kloos, C.

This MOOC was delivered by several professors from the Universidad Carlos III de Madrid and was supported by several external social tools that promoted the creation of a community of learners as part of it. The contribution of this study is a list of insights and recommendations about both the design and deployment of MOOCs. These insights and recommendations are built upon those presented in previous works by the authors. The design recommendations include information about the overall course structure, the assessment activities, the certification of the course, and the use of complementary social tools. The deployment recommendations mainly focus on the role of the teaching staff when running the course and on the importance of social tools and communication tools as a mechanism for participant engagement throughout the course. These recommendations aim to be useful for other practitioners, instructional designers and policy makers addressing the challenge of designing and deploying a MOOC from scratch.","Deployment; Design; Insights; Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs); Recommendations; Social tools","Curricula; Design; Ecology; Ecosystems; Education; Teaching; Assessment activities; Community of learners; Deployment; Design recommendations; Insights; Instructional designer; Massive open online course; Recommendations; E-learning",,,,,,,,,,,,"Alario-Hoyos, C., Pérez-Sanagustín, M., Delgado-Kloos, C., Parada, G.H.A., Muñoz-Organero, M., Delving into participants' profiles and use of social tools in MOOCs IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies, , in press; Alario-Hoyos, C., Pérez-Sanagustín, M., Delgado-Kloos, C., Gutiérrez-Rojas, I., Leony, D., Parada, G.H.A., Designing your first MOOC from scratch: Recommendations after teaching 'Digital Education of the Future' (2014) ELearning Papers, from the Field, 37 (3), pp. 1-7; Alario-Hoyos, C., Pérez-Sanagustín, M., Delgado Kloos, C., Parada, G.H.A., Muñoz-Organero, M., Rodríguez-Delas-Heras, A., Analysing the impact of built-in and external Social Tools in a MOOC on Educational Technologies (2013) Proceedings of the 8th European Conference on Technology Enhanced Learning, EC-TEL 2013, LNCS, 8095, pp. 5-18; Alario-Hoyos, C., Pérez-Sanagustín, M., Cormier, D., Delgado Kloos, C., Proposal for a conceptual framework for educators to describe and design MOOCs (2014) Journal of Universal Computer Science (JUCS, 20 (1), pp. 6-23; Belanger, Y., Thornton, J., Biolelectricity: A quantitative approach: Duke University's first MOOC (2013) Technical Report, , http://dukespace.lib.duke.edu/dspacebitstream/handle/10161/6216/Duke_Bioelectricity_MOOC_Fall2012.pdf; (2013) Building A Coursera Course v 2.0, , http://bit.ly/dukecoursera, Technical Report, Duke Center for Instructional Technology; Cisel, M., Analyzing completion rates in the First French xMOOC (2014) ELearning Papers, from the Field, 37 (6), pp. 1-9; Delgado Kloos, C., Muñoz-Merino, P., Muñoz-Organero, M., Alario-Hoyos, C., Pérez-Sanagustín, M., Parada, G., Ruipérez, J.A.H.A., Sanz, J.L., Experiences running MOOCs and SPOCs at UC3M (2014) Proceedings of the 2014 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference, pp. 884-891. , EDUCON; Díaz, G., García Loro, F., Tawfik, M., Sancristobal, E., Martin, S., Castro, M., Learning electronics through a remote laboratory MOOC (2014) Proceedings of the European MOOC Stakeholder Summit 2014, EMOOCs, pp. 214-217; Guo, P.J., Kim, J., Rubin, R., How video production affects student engagement: An empirical study of mooc videos (2014) Proceedings of the ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale, pp. 41-50; Kop, R., Fournier, H., Mak, S.F.J., A pedagogy of abundance or a pedagogy to support human beings?

However, there is very little research exploring MOOCs in the discipline of health and medicine. Objective: We aim to provide a review of MOOCs related to health and medicine offered by various MOOC platforms in 2013, by analyzing and comparing the various offerings, their target audience, typical length of course, and credentials offered. We also discuss opportunities and challenges presented by MOOCs in health and medicine. Methods: Health and medicine-related MOOCs were gathered using several methods to ensure the richness and completeness of data. Identified MOOC platform websites were used to gather the lists of offerings. In parallel, these MOOC platforms were contacted to access official data on their offerings. Two MOOC aggregator sites (Class Central and MOOC List) were also consulted to gather data on MOOC offerings. Eligibility criteria were defined to concentrate on the courses that were offered in 2013 and primarily on the subject of health and medicine. All language translations in this paper were done using Google Translate. Results: The search identified 225 courses, of which 98 were eligible for the review. Over half (58%, 57/98) of the MOOCs considered were offered on the Coursera platform, and 94% (92/98) of all the MOOCs were offered in English. Universities offered 90 MOOCs, and the John Hopkins University offered the largest number of MOOCs (12/90). Only three MOOCs were offered by developing countries (China, West Indies, and Saudi Arabia). The duration of MOOCs varied from 3-20 weeks with an average length of 6.7 weeks. On average, MOOCs expected a participant to work on the material for 4.2 hours a week. Verified certificates were offered by 14 MOOCs, while three others offered other professional recognition. Conclusions: The review presents evidence to suggest that MOOCs can be used as a way to provide continuous medical education. It also shows the potential of MOOCs as a means of increasing health literacy among the public. ©Tharindu Rekha Liyanagunawardena, Shirley Ann Williams.","Computer-assisted instruction; Continuing education; Education; eLearning; Health education","education; health education; Internet; medical education; procedures; university; Education, Distance; Education, Medical, Continuing; Health Education; Internet; Universities",,,,,,,,,,,,"Downes, S.I., Places to go: Connectivism & connective knowledge (2008) Journal of Online Education, , http://bsili.3csn.org/files/2010/06/Places_to_Go-_Connectivism_Connective_Knowledge.pdf, [accessed 2014-08-09] [WebCite Cache ID 6Rh66Z5aH]; Liyanagunawardena, T.R., Adams, A.A., Williams, S.A., MOOCs: A Systematic Study of the Published Literature 2008-2012 (2013) International Review of Research in Open and Distance Learning, 14 (3), pp. 201-227. , [FREE Full text] [WebCite Cache]; Siemens, G., Connectivism - A learning theory for the digital age (2005) International Journal of Instructional Technology and Distance Learning, 2 (1), pp. 3-10; Yuan, L., Powell, S., JISC ECTIS (Centre for Educational Technology and Interoperability Standards), (2013) MOOCs and Open Education: Implications for Higher Education - A White Paper, , http://publications.cetis.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/MOOCs-and-Open-Education.pdf, [accessed 2014-07-15] [WebCite Cache ID 6R5L67mhj]; Liyanagunawardena, T.R., Parslow, P., Williams, S.A., Dropout: MOOC participants'perspective (2014) EMOOCs 2014 the Second MOOC European Stakeholders Summit; February 10-12, 2014; Lausanne, Switzerland, pp. 95-100. , Proceedings of EMOOCs 2014, the Second MOOC European Stakeholders Summit.

The success of these massive courses is based on involving students to acquire knowledge and skills in a wider community by learning from others and using active learning practices. MOOC providers also help universities to support the mission of transferring knowledge to society in any kind of area, supporting lifelong learning and adopting some kind of internationalization strategy. This is an ongoing trend where 17 of top 30 universities in the world's adopted MOOC courses. Open learning is a strategic and valuable trend in knowledge society. Opportunities appear in the Anglo and Latin American market, while problems associated with the high drop-out rate, the sustainability, and the feasibility of skill certification should be addressed. In this paper we analyze the properties of a MOOC as a learning community by taking data from a pilot of three MOOC courses performed at AbiertaUGR, the MOOC platform of the University of Granada.

In part due to the ease of enrolling, low completion rates have been a notable characteristic of MOOCs with as few as 5 - 10% of enrolled students gaining a certificate of completion. Beyond these observations, little is known about the patterns of attrition, nor how they may vary amongst different groups of MOOC participants. Activity data was analysed from log records collected from 42 MOOCs run by Stanford University between 2011 and 2013 on Coursera. A novel analysis was applied to the data which showed that attrition varies little between those that audited the course and those that actively participated in assessments. The results indicate that attrition is not influenced by levels of participation in a MOOC and attrition is further not greatly influenced by attributes of the course.","MOOCs; Student attrition","Education; Students; Massive open online course; MOOCs; Stanford University; E-learning",,,,,,,,,,,,"Angelino, L.M., Williams, F.K., Natvig, D., Strategies to engage online students and reduce attrition rates (2007) Journal of Educators Online, 4 (2), p. n2; Belanger, Y., Thornton, J., (2013) Bioelectricity: A Quantitative Approach Duke University's First MOOC, , http://hdl.handle.net/10161/6216, Retrieved from; Breslow, L.B., Pritchard, D.E., DeBoer, J., Stump, G.S., Ho, A.D., Seaton, D.T., Studying learning in the worldwide classroom: Research into edx's first mooc (2013) Research & Practice in Assessment, 8, pp. 13-25; Carini, R.M., Kuh, G.D., Klein, S.P., Student engagement and student learning: Testing the linkages (2006) Research in Higher Education, 47 (1), pp. 1-32; (2014) Coursera Website, , http://www.coursera.org, Coursera, .

While online education is still criticized with quality, MOOC is extolled publicly on the value and quality potential of online education by elite institutions with millions of dollars in investments (Hill, 2012). Furthermore, MOOC is frequently open for all to enroll with no cost. It is called free courses, free education, etc. Coursera, an MOOC platform offered by Stanford University, now has more than 1.3 million students enrolling in more than 200 courses from 32 universities.

In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in MOOC from education and information systems researchers. In this paper, the aim is to observe MOOC in their natural setting to examine a particular community of MOOC by drawing on the concepts of communities of practice as a theoretical lens. One of the most significant current discussions on MOOC is Coursera. Questions have been raised about the structure of an emergent type of community within MOOC. However, far too little attention has been paid to study community of practice in this type of online education. The authors conducted an online ethnographic study on a sample of discussion forums of Coursera. Discussions were qualitatively content analyzed in order to understand the structure of an emergent type of community within MOOC. Our findings suggest that cohesion in a MOOC community is brought about by the domain of doubts, questions, new knowledge, experiences and the community of learners who meet people around the world with similar interests; the practices of documents, information, ideas, stories, experiences and software sharing. The combination of forces for MOOC community are global, free and online education identity of community which provides great materials, top professors, mass participation and certificates from top universities; voting system for warrant; movement of new comers from peripheral to the core of community by contributing more in discussions.","Community of practice; Coursera; Knowledge sharing; Massive online open courses (MOOC);

MOOCs are considered a means for democratizing education. These courses will hopefully provide an opportunity for individuals to learn from the best educators in the world, as well as help expand their personal networks, and facilitate their career development. However, research thus far shows that the majority of people taking advantage of these courses are already employed, have post-secondary degrees, and have encountered few barriers related to the affordability of higher education. Little is known about MOOC learners with financial constraints and who do not fit the typical profile of MOOC learners. This paper presents the results of the analysis of data from six Coursera courses offered by the University of Michigan from fall 2012 through winter 2013. In this analysis learners who self-identified as being unable to afford to pursue a formal education (the target group) were contrasted to other learners (the comparison group) in terms of demographics, motivations, course enrollment, engagement and performance. Learners in the target group were primarily male and over 25 years old. A statistically significant portion of the target group held less than a 4-year college degree than the comparison group. Target learners were also significantly underrepresented in the enrollment of the courses examined here. Although the comparison group had a significantly higher completion rate overall than the target group, the target group had a statistically significant higher rate of completing courses with certificates of distinction. This article provides a discussion of these results and suggests how MOOCs could be adapted to better address the needs of learners who feel financially unable to pursue a more traditional path to a post-secondary education. © Dillahunt, Wang, Teasley.","Affordability; Education; Massive open online courses; Online learning",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Christensen, G., Steinmetz, A., Alcorn, B., Bennett, A., Woods, D., Emanuel, E., The MOOC phenomenon: Who takes massive open online courses and why?

The practical aim of this project was to create, implement, and evaluate a platform about human rights that was available to any Kenyan for free in order to increase knowledge and engagement. Therefore, a non-formal massive open online course (MOOC) about human rights was designed and launched. The course was free and open to anyone in Kenya and offered both a digital badge and certificate from Stockholm University in Sweden upon completion. The course was called Haki Zangu (Kiswahili for ""My Rights""), and it explored how using incentives such as a digital badge and certificate of completion affected learning outcomes. This course offered ubiquitous access based on principles of responsive web design and used audio recordings of the entire course content. The course is perpetual and still on-going, but after six months there were 160 participants who had enrolled, and ten participants had completed the course and received certificates and digital badges. The participants showed extensive enthusiasm and engagement for human rights issues, and they expressed desires to learn more and further spread knowledge about human rights. The current findings suggest that the availability of digital badges and certificates increased interest for participation and positively affected learning outcomes. Moreover, the use of a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) format with incentives proved successful, combined with the contextualization and accessibility of the course content. Furthermore, the technical platform proved adequate for disseminating education for free in a developing country, and allowed for unencumbered access regardless of device. Lastly, a key challenge for future non-formal learning efforts in developing countries is the cost of Internet access.","Digital badges; Human rights; ICT4D; Mobile learning; Non-formal learning",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abramovich, S., Schunn, C., Higashi, R.M., Are Badges Useful in Education: It Depends upon the Type of Badge and Expertise of Learner (2013) Educational Technology Research and Development, 61 (2), pp. 217-232; Akker, J.v.d., Gravemeijer, K., McKenney, S., Nieveen, N., (2006) Educational Design Research, , Taylor & Francis; Akker, J.v.d., Principles and Methods of Development Research (1999) Design Approaches and Tools in Education and Training, pp. 1-14. , http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-011-4255-7_1, In Akker, J can den Branch, R.M., Gustafson, K., Nieveen, N. & Plomp, T.

The current higher education system cannot satisfy this need in many fields, e.g. Gartner predicts, that already in 2015 only a third of jobs for big data analysts can be filled [2]. The rapid development of Information and Communication Technology (ITC, IT) has changed many aspects of teaching and learning. Educational materials are moving into cloud(s) and degrees are given on-line ('Master's Degree Online Directory' lists over 90,000 programs [3]), old-fashioned Colleges and Universities with large campus, staff and high costs are getting more and more competition from numerous educational entrepreneurs, who start massive open online courses (MOOC) with millions of users/students from all around the world; they establish new on-line universities where costs of obtaining a degree are marginal compared to 'brick-and-mortal' universities and which are open to nearly everyone independent of user geographical location. Until now MOOC have not yet proved their value-less than 4% of enrollees complete the courses [4] and they do not receive (yet) university diploma. But the World most prestigious technical university, MIT, has already set up a certification system - students who can master the subjects taught in MOOC receive an official certificate of completion [5]. Although these certificates will not carry the weight of a traditional MIT diploma (they will be issued by started by MIT online learning initiative called MITx), but the word 'MIT' alone carries a weight. When speaking about possibilities of IT in education most speakers/writers are excitedly discussing technology-servers, communication lines, bandwidth, security (preferably all in thick cloud of technical jargon). Nearly nobody presents practical experience, suggestions and/or theories about how to teach with this new technology in order best to utilize its possibilities. The 'education in the cloud' mainly consists of video clips trying to repeat the classroom experience: recorded before the old-fashioned blackboard (only nowadays it is white), where professor is presenting the same lecture what he presented in lecture hall, only now lectures are cut into 5-10 min video clips - the 'mobile approach'. Is this why the old lecture halls are still needed? Rapidly increasing costs of University Education, increasing competition of educational entrepreneurs and constant increase of population of working students have made clear, that both sides of University education - teaching/learning and accrediting, giving diplomas need changes. University Education should more take into account students informal and non-formal learning, their participation in professional work - both in organization of study and in certification. In the following are considered several aspects of current situation, presented practices which authors use when teaching IT students and examined possible changes in universities teaching and certification methods. © 2014 MIPRO.",,"Auditoriums; Big data; Costs; Microelectronics; Societies and institutions; Students; Teaching; Video cameras; Certification methods; Colleges and universities; Geographical locations; Higher education system; Information and Communication Technologies; Massive open online course; Postsecondary education; Technical universities; E-learning",,,,,,,,,,,,"http://www9.georgetown.edu/grad/gppi/hpi/cew/pdfs/Recovery2020.ES.Web.pdf, Recovery.

The original dataset contained information about students (username, IP address, country, self-reported level of education, self-reported year of birth, and self-reported gender), the course ID, and information about student activity in the course. Two variables in the original dataset as identifiers and six variables as quasi-identifiers were defined. Course ID was considered a quasi-identifier since students might take unique combinations of courses and because it provides a link between PII posted in forums and the person-course dataset.

The impact of information technology in our day-to-day life has been profound. Because of this many cross disciplines that have been enriched (or benefited) by information technology, and the educational media is a major one among them. On the context of eLearning, Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC) [20] had contributed a larger portion to deliver an integration of learning, teaching and assessment. MOOC is a Web-based tool for distance-learning environment, designed for the participation of large numbers of geographically dispersed audience [11]. In addition, Google and other companies are involved in the design and funding towards a low-cost eLearning. Niche market provides certification courses via MOOC, to satisfy the employee's specific needs [12]. However, in the present day context the opinion on embracing MOOC by any University has been quite debatable. Addressing this debate on both sides, this paper presents the opinion expressed by the stakeholders in education towards embracing MOOC. The survey is focused on providing a consolidated fact that is based on penetration of eLearning. A survey was carried out to provide a solid analysis of eLearning with the help of IT infrastructure in India. On the analysis of the survey from faculty, students and system administrator it revealed demographic distribution of 39.6 percentages from the overall participant of 792 out of 2000. Based on the findings from the study, the paper also discusses the challenge and broad concerns applicable to eLearning in India.","Distance education; Education; eLearning; MOOC; Online education","Computer aided instruction; Costs; Distance education; Education; Surveys; Certification course; Demographic distributions; Distance learning environment; Massive open online course; MOOC; On-line education; System administrators; Teaching and assessments; E-learning",,,,,,,,,,,,"Block, J., Distance Education and the Digital Divide An Academic Perspective (2010) Online J.

However, both MOOC as in any of these new hybrid models, has a series of motivational components of learning, one of them are the badges or certificates that try to justify the student motivation in learning. The key to success of a badge could be on the prestige gained within the social circle of the student, the sustainability of massive online courses could depend on it. The most prestigious certificates could cover the costs of MOOC courses, while other less prestigious badges serve as a reward to motivate the students. However, it is not clear that these rewards could motivate to the students, this paper try to clarify this approach in the context of the massive online courses.","Accreditations; Badges; Learning; MOOC; Motivation",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Boeree, C.G., (1904) Teorías de la Personalidad., , BF Skinner; Bruner, J., (1969) Hacia Una Teoría de la Instrucción, , México, UTEHA; Goligoski, E., Motivating the learner: Mozilla's open badges program (2012) Access to Knowledge A Course Journal, 4 (1). , http://ojs.stanford.edu/ojs/index.php/a2k/article/view/381; Govea, M.G., Vázquez, N.I.P., Rangel, C.F.H., La motivación y los sistemas de recompensas y su impacto en la producción (2012) Contribuciones A la Economía, , 2012-07; Ibarrola López Davalillo, B.D., (2006) La Educación de Las Emociones en E.

In this paper, a review of the current published literature focusing on the use of MOOCs by instructors or students was conducted. Our primary goal in doing this is to summarize the accumulated state of knowledge concerning the main motivations and challenges of using MOOCs, as well as to identify issues that have yet to be fully addressed or resolved. Our findings suggest four reasons why students sign up for MOOCs: the desire to learn about a new topic or to extend current knowledge, they were curious about MOOCs, for personal challenge, and the desire to collect as many completion certificates as possible. Up to 90% drop out due to reasons including a lack of incentive, failure to understand the content material and having no one to turn to for help, and having other priorities to fulfill. Findings suggest three main reasons why instructors wish to teach MOOCs: being motivated by a sense of intrigue, the desire to gain some personal (egoistic) rewards, or a sense of altruism. Four key challenges of teaching MOOCs are also surfaced: difficulty in evaluating students' work, having a sense of speaking into a vacuum due to the absence of student immediate feedback, being burdened by the heavy demands of time and money, and encountering a lack of student participation in online forums. We conclude by discussing two issues that have yet to be fully resolved - the quality of MOOC education, and the assessment of student work. © 2014.","E-learning; Massive open online course; MOOC; Motivation; Online learning",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Agarwal, A., 'Circuits and Electronics', MITx (2012) Chronicle of Higher Education, 59 (6), pp. B10; Allon, G., 'Operations Management', Udemy (2012) Chronicle of Higher Education, 59 (6), pp. B10-11; Batson, C.D., Ahmad, N., Tsang, J.A., Four motives for community involvement (2002) Journal of Social Issues, 58 (3), pp. 429-445; Belanger, Y., Thornton, J., (2013), http://dukespace.lib.duke.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/10161/6216/Duke_Bioelectricity_MOOC_Fall2012.pdf, Bioelectricity: A quantitative approach.

Some components are graded, which means that they play a key role in a student's final grade and certificate attainment. It is not yet clear how the due date structure of graded components affects student outcomes including academic performance and alternative modes of learning of students. Using data from HarvardX and MITx, Harvard's and MIT's divisions for online learning, we study the structure of due dates on graded components for 10 completed MOOCs. We find that stricter due dates are associated with higher certificate attainment rates but fewer students who join late being able to earn a certificate. Our findings motivate further studies of how the use of graded components and deadlines affects academic and alternative learning of MOOC students, and can help inform the design of online courses.","Due dates; MOOC; MOOC structure; Student performance","Curricula; Students; Academic performance; Due dates; Massive open online course; MOOC; Online course; Online learning; Student outcomes; Student performance; E-learning",,,,,,,,,,,,"Breslow, L., Pritchard, D., DeBoer, J., Stump, G., Ho, A., Seaton, D., Studying learning in the worldwide classroom: Research into edX's first MOOC (2013) Research & Practice in Assessment, 8, pp. 13-25; DeBoer, J., Ho, A.D., Stump, G.S., Breslow, L., Changing ""course,"": Reconceptualizing Educational Variables for Massive Open Online Courses; Kizilcec, R., Piech, C., Schneider, E., (2013) Deconstructing Disengagement: Analyzing Learner Subpopulations in Massive Open Online Courses; Klapp, A., MOOCs open doors for diverse student body (2013) Diversity Journal; Nesterko, S.O., Dotsenko, S., Han, Q., Seaton, D., Reich, J., Chuang, I., Ho, A.D., Evaluating the geographic data in moocs (2013) Neural Information Processing Systems",,,"ACM Education Board","Association for Computing Machinery","1st ACM Conference on Learning at Scale, L@S 2014","4 March 2014 through 5 March 2014","Atlanta, GA",104894,,,,,"English","LS - Proc.

Researchers, educators, and the general public have recently become interested in how the learning experience in MOOCs differs from that in traditional courses. A major component of the learning experience is how students navigate through course content. This paper presents an empirical study of how students navigate through MOOCs, and is, to our knowledge, the first to investigate how navigation strategies differ by demographics such as age and country of origin. We performed data analysis on the activities of 140, 546 students in four edX MOOCs and found that certificate earners skip on average 22% of the course content, that they frequently employ non-linear navigation by jumping backward to earlier lecture sequences, and that older students and those from countries with lower student-teacher ratios are more comprehensive and non-linear when navigating through the course. From these findings, we suggest design recommendations such as for MOOC platforms to develop more detailed forms of certification that incentivize students to deeply engage with the content rather than just doing the minimum necessary to earn a passing grade. Finally, to enable other researchers to reproduce and build upon our findings, we have made our data set and analysis scripts publicly available.","Massive open online course; MOOC; Navigation strategy; Non-linear learning","Curricula; Navigation; Population statistics; Students; Teaching; Design recommendations; Learning experiences; Massive open online course; MOOC; Navigation strategies; Non-linear navigation; Nonlinear learning; Traditional course; E-learning",,,,,,,,,,,,"MaxMind GeoIP Databases and Web Services, , http://www.maxmind.com/en/geolocation_landing; Bates, T., (2012) What's Right and What's Wrong About Coursera-style MOOCs?, , http://www.tonybates.ca/2012/08/05/whats-right-and-whats-wrong-about- coursera-\style-moocs/, Blog entry retrieved; Breslow, L., Pritchard, D.E., DeBoer, J., Stump, G.S., Ho, A.D., Seaton, D.T., Studying learning in the worldwide classroom: Research into edX's first MOOC (2013) Research and Practice in Assessment, 8; Chen, S.Y., Ford, N.J., Modelling user navigation behaviours in a hypermedia-based learning system: An individual differences approach (1998) Knowledge Organization, 25 (3), pp. 67-78; Cheng, Y.W., Sudweeks, F., Cheng, Y.W., Sudweeks, F., A longitudinal study on the effect of hypermedia on learning dimensions, culture and teaching evaluation (2012) Proc.

Universities and colleges worldwide increasingly use online platforms to offer courses open to the public. Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) give millions of people access to education from prestigious universities. Although some courses provide certification of attendance and completion, most do not provide any academic or professional recognition since this would imply a rigorous and complete evaluation of the student's achievements. Since the number of students enrolled may exceed tens of thousands, it is impractical for a lecturer (or group of lecturers) to evaluate all students using conventional hand marking. To be scalable, assessment must be automated. State-of-the-art automated assessment includes multiple choice questions and intelligent marking techniques (involving complex semantic analysis). However, none of these alone can cope with very large student populations of students and guarantee the evaluation quality required for higher education. The goal of this research is to create and evaluate a computer mediated social interaction system for massive online learning communities. This must be scalable and able to assess fairly and accurately student coursework and examinations. We call this approach ""machine and socially intelligent peer assessment"". We describe our system and illustrate its application. It combines peer assessment and reputation systems to provide independent computerised assessment. Assignment of student markers to scripts is based on reputation scores which emerge from their marking behaviour. A simulation experiment shows how reputation-based social structure evolves in our peer marking system. A pilot experiment with ninety 16-year old high school students in Colombia tested the marking accuracy of our system by comparing the statistical differences between teacher-marked 'gold standard' scores, peer assessment using average scores, and our intelligent reputation-based peer assessment. The research question is to what extent does the proposed approach improve peer marking in terms of marking accuracy and fairness? We report the first results of this experiment, summarise the lessons learned, and describe further work.","Automated marking; Complex systems education; Étoile; MOOCs; Peer assessment; Reputation systems","E-learning; Experiments; Quality control; Semantics; Societies and institutions; Systems science; Teaching; Automated marking; MOOCs; Peer assessment; Reputation systems; Systems education; Students",,,,,,,,,,,,"American Psychological Association, & National Council on Measurement in Education (1999), American Educational Research Association, Standards for educational and psychological testing.

The preliminary findings obtained during a trial period by students watching videos from home and enrolled at University of Pisa in Italy, indicate that the use of Pinvox can be one step towards, not only ensuring the integrity of on-line certification, but also to sustain student attention and memory retention.

It creates a dilemma of providing engineering education anywhere in the World, preserving local cultural values, and applying it anywhere around the Globe. A recent Singapore Declaration [ASEE Global Forum, 2009], and consecutive World Engineering Education Forums, [1] paved the roadmap towards Global Engineering calling for practical solutions to implement the vision of a global engineer. In response to these challenges, several 'disruptive innovation' [Christensen, 1995] solutions such as Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC) and Massive Open Online Laboratories (MOOL) have been introduced including the one based on the Internet of Things (IOT) and disruptive microelectronics [2]. Disruptive Microelectronics which includes embedded systems, Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC), Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA), and (Programmable Systems On a Chip (PSOC), is one of excellent case studies of disruptive technologies (or disruptive innovation) which is defined as an innovation that helps create a new market and value network, and eventually goes on to disrupt an existing market and value network (over a few years or decades), displacing an earlier technology. The Internet of Things is the next generation of the Internet connecting objects, not just people. Since the ultimate goal is to produce new industries globally, understanding, measuring, evaluating, and preserving the integrity of global engineering becomes fundamental. The latter is proposed to be addressed by Quality Assessment (QA) of emerging global engineering curricula and scholars involved in teaching of global engineering. For example, International Society for Engineering Education (IGIP) is one of the leaders providing international certification of scholars and one of the frontrunners in fostering engineering on line, critical for global engineering. The overall process of global engineering education addressing essential skills for engineers from any country to be competitive in an international market for engineering knowhow, with skills not longer limited to cultural sensitivity needed only for product design destined for diverse markets can be superbly captured by Service Science [Spohrer, 2008]. Service science is an interdisciplinary paradigm to the study, design, and implementation of complex systems in which specific arrangements of people and technologies take actions that provide value for others [3]. It is also a proposed academic discipline and research area that would complement multiplicity of disciplines that contribute to knowledge about service. The interdisciplinary nature of the field calls for a curriculum and competencies to advance the development and contribution of the field of service science using so called the T-Shape curricula as shown in Figure 1. The vertical bar in T represents the depth of knowledge a student is majoring in whereas the horizontal bar corresponds to the multidisciplinary knowledge gained by the student. The proposed IOT based curricula corresponds to the service science platform represented by a modified T-Shape diagram surrounded by the circle representing the IOT universe as depicted in Figure 2. The model solution of Online Engineering is motivated by: (1) the search for Cost Effective and 'Democratic' Online Engineering; (2) the definition of Global Engineering Solution. Furthermore, the approach is based on Disruptive Education, as defined by Christensen, and the underlying technology is derived from the Internet of Things defined as a Web of Objects (Rao, 2010). The Web of Objects (WOO) is a superset of the Internet of Things which enables, as stated above, worldwide interaction among objects without human intervention as well as the Internet, a classic medium facilitating communication among people. The presented Online Engineering platform, called WOO3©, is a triple WOO based model and ecosystem (WOO3©) which includes: (1) IOT based eLearning; (2) IOT based subject matters; and (3) IOT based online engineering. The service science context of the proposed meta level global range curricula development can be concisely depicted in Figure 3. The Internet of Things based curricula (the center of Figure 3) function as an enabler and accelerator for transforming existing curricula represented by the original Vitruvian Man on the left of Figure 3 into a monetary version of the Vitruvian man depicted on a one Euro Italian coin shown on the right side of Figure 3. The latter symbolizes the creation of new services generated by global engineering. The QA component of the proposed curricula is derived from the existing IGIP system for certification already in place. IGIP ING PAED Certification supports institutional and programmatic accreditation by providing an opportunity for engineering educators to obtain the pedagogical expertise that enables them to design modernized courses and curricula, employ sound pedagogic practice in the classroom, and produce students who will possess the skills required to by industrial constituents and to become the global engineers of the 21st Century. Consequently, engineering on line and on line engineering practices are being introduced to provide a technology platform enabling more accessible curricula. The curricula may emphasize engineering topics across multiple engineering disciplines, non-engineering topics such as English, or a mixture of both. It is also important to add that the IGIP ING PAED Certification is relying on local academic heritage as much as possible to preserve both cultural and traditional assets of pedagogical practices. IGIP accredits training centers for 'International Engineering Educators', the teaching matter of which conforms to IGIP's curriculum for engineering pedagogy. The curriculum is proposed and developed by an institution or center according to the needs of regional educational systems and within the framework of the IGIP prototype curriculum. There are currently 42 IGIP-accredited ING PAED training centers in Europe, Asia and Brazil. The regional workshops may be particularly relevant in the following regions: Central Asia - A regional online certification program would support the current international accreditation effort through the QUEECA (Quality Assurance in Engineering Education in Central Asia) project, Building on an existing IGIP ING.PAED certification program in Kazakhstan, a regional program could support certification in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. Seminars and workshops could be offered in conjunction with the Kazakhstan-Indo-US Collaboration for Engineering Education (KIUCEE). India - The Indo-US Collaboration for Engineering Education (IUCEE) is aiming to build a solid base for engineering education and research by strengthening the four pillars of education: learner-centric teaching; research excellence; outcomes based quality supported by accreditation; and innovation and entrepreneurship. [4] Latin America - The Latin American and Caribbean Consortium of Engineering Institutions (LACCEI) has designed a program for faculty development based on the International Society for Engineering Education (IGIP) curriculum.

Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) attempt to achieve this feat by taking the class experience, as it is, online. These special types of learning courses have boomed vastly in the past year, triggered by an Artificial Intelligence course offering of Stanford fellows Sebastian Thrun and Peter Norvig. MOOC is different in the aspect that they generally have deadlines and provide certificates of accomplishments. Homework assignment deadlines are mostly weekly on the topics taught in a given week. In this paper, the major MOOC organizations are introduced and their track is discussed. © 2012 IEEE.","MOOC; Online Higher Education","Artificial intelligence; Engineering education; Planning; Sustainable development; Artificial intelligence course; Higher education; Homework assignments; Learning course; Massive open online course; MOOC; On-line education; Sebastian; E-learning",,,,,,,,,,,,"Daphne Koller: What We're Learning from Online Education | Video on TED.

Open Educational Resources (OER) and Open Educational Practice (OEP) are mushrooming and Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC) are here already. The idea of moving away from battery-type Academic Development Activities and silo modules and programmes towards open cross-institutional approaches in line with OEP are explored within this paper based on a recent small-scale, fully-online study. This brought together academics and other professionals who support learning, from different disciplines and professional areas who are studying towards a Postgraduate Certificate (PgCert) in Teaching and Learning in HE/Academic Practice during a facilitated open Problem-Based Learning (PBL) task around assessment and feedback using freely available social media. The study aimed to explore if and how online PBL can be used within PgCert provisions to provide opportunities to connect, communicate and collaborate in a community of practice beyond institutional walls. The phenomenographic methodology underpinned this research. Participants' experiences in this open Academic Development activity were captured through individual remote interviews, a series of questionnaires and reflective accounts. Findings indicate that open online PBL has the potential to enable learners and educators to break out of academic and virtual silos. It also widens meaningful collaborative learning within Academic Development in multi-disciplinary and multi-institutional groups -something participants in this study commented extremely positively about. This provides evidence that freeing AD is the way forward to share available resources, and establish more organic and healthy learning communities beyond the module, programme and institutional level. Recommendations are made to Academic Developers and other tutors on how to bring learners from different programmes, institutions and countries together online using social media to create the conditions and the environment for a meaningful, rich and fruitful exchange and enable collaborative formal and informal learning.","Academic development; Open educational practice; Phenomenography; Problem-based learning; Social media","E-learning; Social networking (online); Societies and institutions; Surveys; Teaching; Academic development; Open educational practice; Phenomenography; Problem based learning; Social media; Education",,,,,,,,,,,,"Barrett, T., The problem-based learning process as finding and being in flow (2010) Innovation in Education and Teaching International, 47 (2), pp. 165-174. , May 2010, Routledge; Barrows, H.S., Tamblyn, R.M., (1980) Problem-based Learning.
