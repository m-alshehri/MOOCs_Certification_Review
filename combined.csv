ACM,Conference Paper,"Rohloff T,Sauer D,Meinel C",Students' Achievement of Personalized Learning Objectives in MOOCs,2020,"Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) provide the opportunity to offer free and open education at scale. Thousands of students with different social and cultural backgrounds from all over the world can enroll for a course. This diverse audience comes with varying motivations and intentions from their personal or professional life. However, course instructors cannot offer individual support and guidance at this scale and therefore usually provide a one-size-fits-all approach. Students have to follow weekly-structured courses and their success is measured with the achievement of a certificate at the end. To better address the varying learning needs, technical support for goal-oriented and self-regulated learning is desired but very limited to date. Both learning strategies are proven to be key factors for students' achievement in large-scale online learning environments. Therefore, this paper presents a continuative study of personalized learning objectives in MOOCs to encourage goal-oriented and self-regulated learning. Based on the previously well-perceived acceptance and usefulness of the concept of personalized learning objectives, this study examines which learners select an objective and how successful they complete objectives. Concerning the learners' socio-demographic and geographical background, we could not identify any practical significant difference between students with selected learning objectives and the total course population. However, we have identified promising objective achievement rates, and we have observed a practical significant improvement of the certification rates comparing the total course population and students who selected an objective that included a graded certificate. This has also demonstrated a method for calculating more reasonable completion rates in MOOCs.",https://doi.org/10.1145/3386527.3405918;http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3386527.3405918,Proceedings of the Seventh ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,L@S '20,,,,
ACM,Conference Paper,"Ilham D,Mostafa E,Mohamed K",Towards a New Approach to Reduce the Dropout Rate in E-Learning,2020,"MOOCs are currently facing a major problem, namely the decrease in the rate of certified at the end of a MOOC. The main cause of this problem is due to the difficulty of detecting user behaviors in the platform which does not help tutors in their follow-up and their educational supervision of learners as well as to interact easily with them.In this work, to solve this problem we will propose an information system capable of automatically analyzing and detecting the behavior of users who follow a distance training and subsequently, to classify their profiles according to predefined parameters to facilitate teachers choose courses and activities based on the behavior of each user.",https://doi.org/10.1145/3386723.3387846;http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3386723.3387846,"Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference on Networking, Information Systems & Security",NISS2020,,,,
ACM,Conference Paper,"Littenberg-Tobias J,Ruipérez-Valiente JA,Reich J",Impact of Free-Certificate Coupons on Learner Behavior in Online Courses: Results from Two Case Studies,2019,"The relationship between pricing and learning behavior is an increasingly important topic in MOOC (massive open online course) research. We report on two case studies where cohorts of learners were offered coupons for free-certificates to explore price reductions might influence user behavior in MOOC-based online learning settings. In Case Study #1, we compare participation and certification rates between courses with and without coupons for free-certificates. In the courses with a free-certificate track, participants signed up for the verified certificate track at higher rates and completion rates among verified students were higher than in the paid-certificate track courses. In Case Study #2, we compare the behaviors of learners within the same courses based on whether they received access to a free-certificate track. Access to free-certificates was associated with somewhat lower certification rates, but overall certification rates remained high particularly among those who viewed the courses. These findings suggests that some other incentives, other than simply the sunk-cost of paying for a verified certificate-track, may motivate learners to complete MOOC courses.",https://doi.org/10.1145/3330430.3333654;http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3330430.3333654,Proceedings of the Sixth (2019) ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,L@S '19,,,,
ACM,Conference Paper,"Wang L,Hemberg E,O'Reilly UM",On the Influence of Grades on Learning Behavior of Students in MOOCs,2019,"MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) frequently use grades to calculate whether a student passes the course. To better understand how student behavior is influenced by grade feedback, we conduct a study on the changes of certified students' behavior before and after they have received their grade. We use observational student data from two MITx MOOCs to examine student behavior before and after a grade is released and calculate the difference (the delta-activity). We then analyze the changes in the delta-activity distributions across all graded assignments a we observe that the variation in delta-activity decreases as grade decreases, with students who have the lowest grade exhibiting little or no change in weekly activity. This trend persists throughout each course, in all course offerings, suggesting that a change in grade does not correlate with a change in the behavior of certified MOOC students.",https://doi.org/10.1145/3330430.3333652;http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3330430.3333652,Proceedings of the Sixth (2019) ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,L@S '19,,,,

There is generally no analogous tracing of learning progression in programming MOOCs, hindering the ability of MOOC platforms to provide automated feedback at scale. We explore features for every certified student's history of code submissions to specific problems in a programming MOOC and measure similarity to sample solutions. We seek to understand whether students who succeed in the course reach solutions similar to these instructor-intended sample solutions, in terms of the concepts and mechanisms they contain. Furthermore, do students learn to conform to instructor expectations as the course progresses, and does prior experience have correlations with student behavior? We also explore what feature representations are sufficient for code submission history, since they are directly applicable to the development of automated tutors for progress tracking.",https://doi.org/10.1145/3330430.3333646;http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3330430.3333646,Proceedings of the Sixth (2019) ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,L@S '19,,,,
ACM,Conference Paper,"Rohloff T,Sauer D,Meinel C",On the Acceptance and Usefulness of Personalized Learning Objectives in MOOCs,2019,"With Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) the number of people having access to higher education increased rapidly. The intentions to enroll for a specific course vary significantly and depend on one's professional or personal learning needs and interests. All learners have in common that they pursue their individual learning objectives. However, predominant MOOC platforms follow a one-size-fits-all approach and primarily aim for completion with certification. Specifically, technical support for goal-oriented and self-regulated learning to date is very limited in this context although both learning strategies are proven to be key factors for students' achievement in large-scale online learning environments. In this first investigation, a concept for the application and technical integration of personalized learning objectives in a MOOC platform is realized and assessed. It is evaluated with a mixed-method approach. First, the learners' acceptance is examined with a multivariate A/B test in two courses. Second, a survey was conducted to gather further feed-back about the perceived usefulness, next to the acceptance. The results show a positive perception by the learners, which paves the way for future research.",https://doi.org/10.1145/3330430.3333624;http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3330430.3333624,Proceedings of the Sixth (2019) ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,L@S '19,,,,

Several proposals are discussed, but as long as the economic model of MOOCs isn't well defined yet, certain institutions and companies keep attracting more learners to enroll and stay in their MOOCs without considering their prerequisites and needs. The aim of our contribution is to recommend enrollment in the MOOCs primarily to learners who have expressed a need or a gap and having prerequisites (i.e. in discussion forums); using LDA Topic Modeling on their shared texts we group the learners according to similar needs and interests, in order to propose for them a useful MOOC.",https://doi.org/10.1145/3289100.3289115;http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3289100.3289115,Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Smart Digital Environment,ICSDE'18,,,,

ACM,Conference Paper,Turrin R,Personalization Challenges in E-Learning,2017,"Online learning is a hot trend in the education industry, as testified by the proliferation of e-learning platforms and MOOCs on a huge variety of topics, from science and technology to foreign language learning and musical instruments playing.In this talk we will present some of the common challenges in the e-learning industry that we are personally facing at Cloud Academy, an on-line continuous training platform for Cloud technologies.First, the nature of recommendation objects is quite diversified. Typically an e-learning platform comprises several content types, such as video lessons, reading material, quizzes, practical exercises (e.g., hands-on laboratories), etc. Also, they can be organized into composite objects, such as whole courses (groups of lessons) or exams (topic-specific quizzes and exercises).Signals are very heterogeneous, too. Users can trigger all sorts of events while interacting with the learning platform, such as time spent on a given lesson video, outcome of a quiz or a test after a specific number of attempts, natural language feedback, etc. Such variety can be an important and comprehensive source of information but it must be normalized and handled within an appropriate common framework.The objectives of recommendation in e-learning differ from the case of more well-established targets. Although enjoyment remains a driving force (e.g., proposing new interesting courses to an old user), the focus is on learning specific skills or topics for specific goals. In this scenario, recommendation seeks to suggest the new best lesson, exercise, or course to acquire the desired skill while keeping the user engaged, assembling a personalized study path in the process. The pace of the learning activity must be tailored on the user's needs and commitments, like deadlines (e.g., the user plans to get a certification by a certain date), specific goals (e.g., objectives of an employee might be defined by the user's manager) or learning prerequisites (e.g., a course can be consumed only after the student has acquired the needed knowledge, either via other more basic courses or pre-existing skills).Consequently, recommendations must take into account the initial user skills and knowledge as well as her learning objectives (e.g., improving the skills of a non-beginner student requires recommending more advanced material). Transparency plays an important role in the e-learning domain as users are willing to continuously monitor and inspect their progress and understand which training resources better fit their learning goals.Finally, the online learning environment can be made even more complex by \",https://doi.org/10.1145/3109859.3109927;http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3109859.3109927,Proceedings of the Eleventh ACM Conference on Recommender Systems," such as virtual classes of multiple users, a context that recommender systems both can exploit and need to take into account.","on-line training, on-line learning, moocs, recommender systems, education",RecSys '17,,

We develop three operationalizations of \",ontrackness\," to measure how students participated in sync with the recommended syllabus. Ontrackness in both versions was low, though in the second, mean ontrackness was approximately one-half of levels in the first HeroesX. We find few differences in persistence, participation, and completion between the two runs. Controlling for a students' number of active weeks, we estimate modest positive effects of ontrackness on certification. The revealed preferences of students for flexibility and the minimal benefits of ontrackness suggest that releasing content all at once may be a viable strategy for MOOC designers.","synchronicity, natural experiment, moocs, ontrackness",L@S '15
ACM,Conference Paper,"Li X,Chang KM,Yuan Y,Hauptmann A",Massive Open Online Proctor: Protecting the Credibility of MOOCs Certificates,2015,"Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) enable everyone to receive high-quality education. However, current MOOC creators cannot provide an effective, economical, and scalable method to detect cheating on tests, which would be required for any certification. In this paper, we propose a Massive Open Online Proctoring (MOOP) framework, which combines both automatic and collaborative approaches to detect cheating behaviors in online tests. The MOOP framework consists of three major components: Automatic Cheating Detector (ACD), Peer Cheating Detector (PCD), and Final Review Committee (FRC). ACD uses webcam video or other sensors to monitor students and automatically flag suspected cheating behavior. Ambiguous cases are then sent to the PCD, where students peer-review flagged webcam video to confirm suspicious cheating behaviors. Finally, the list of suspicious cheating behaviors is sent to the FRC to make the final punishing decision. Our experiment show that ACD and PCD can detect usage of a cheat sheet with good accuracy and can reduce the overall human resources required to monitor MOOCs for cheating.",https://doi.org/10.1145/2675133.2675245;http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2675133.2675245,Proceedings of the 18th ACM Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work & Social Computing,CSCW '15,,,,

ACM,Conference Paper,"Guo PJ,Reinecke K",Demographic Differences in How Students Navigate through MOOCs,2014,"The current generation of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) attract a diverse student audience from all age groups and over 196 countries around the world. Researchers, educators, and the general public have recently become interested in how the learning experience in MOOCs differs from that in traditional courses. A major component of the learning experience is how students navigate through course content.This paper presents an empirical study of how students navigate through MOOCs, and is, to our knowledge, the first to investigate how navigation strategies differ by demographics such as age and country of origin. We performed data analysis on the activities of 140,546 students in four edX MOOCs and found that certificate earners skip on average 22% of the course content, that they frequently employ non-linear navigation by jumping backward to earlier lecture sequences, and that older students and those from countries with lower student-teacher ratios are more comprehensive and non-linear when navigating through the course.From these findings, we suggest design recommendations such as for MOOC platforms to develop more detailed forms of certification that incentivize students to deeply engage with the content rather than just doing the minimum necessary to earn a passing grade.

Online educational pattern, both inside and outside of the campus community, have been become more popular. In recent years, a new research agenda has emerged, focusing on predicting and explaining dropouts and MOOCs with low completion rates. However, due to different problem specifications and evaluation metrics, performing learning analytics (LA) of online education is a challenging task. The online learner has a variety of purposes, such as complete learning courses, some knowledge points in work-based learning courses, selective learning for reviewing exams, certificate-based learning, and watching videos for interest. According to users'online behavior data, it is difficult to study why so many people drop out of MOOCs. Because users have many reasons, such as not understanding, bad network connection, other things to do, and so on.

These prompts increased course completion by 29%, and payment for certificates by 40%. This effect was largest for students enrolled in traditional schools. Furthermore, the contents of students' plans could predict which students were least likely to succeed - in particular, students whose plans focused on specific times were unlikely to complete the course.

The second is characterizing key factors within the course that affect it, and suggesting possible remedies that are likely to decrease the amount of cheating.

ACM,Conference Paper,Yang S,Topical Scopes of Digital and Data Curation Curricula,2015,"We analyzed topical scopes of two digital and two data curation curricula offered as (post)graduate certificates or specializations. We investigated a question of what the topical similarities and differences are between the curricula. To address this question: first, we identified topics from individual course and curriculum descriptions; second, we compared the topics from curriculum descriptions with each other; and third, we compared the topics from course descriptions that are part of a curriculum. We found several topics which were acting as least common denominators between two digital curation and between two data curation curricula. Such topics illustrated the fundamental components within the same type of curricula. The two common topics among all curricula were 'standards' and 'management.' This may indicate the importance of following the standards in preparation of digital (data) objects and in curatorial processes, as well as the importance of continued management of such resources in a repository. Our approach may be applicable to other types of educational opportunities such as workshops, MOOCs, and webinars. As we analyze more curation curricula, we may be able to develop a more accurate and comprehensive topical framework for the domain of digital and data curation, further enhancing the education for future digital and data curators.",,Proceedings of the 78th ASIS&T Annual Meeting: Information Science with Impact: Research in and for the Community,ASIST '15,,,,

ACD uses webcam video or other sensors to monitor students and automatically flag suspected cheating behavior. Ambiguous cases are then sent to the PCD, where students peer-review flagged webcam video to confirm suspicious cheating behaviors.

This paper adapts the topic modeling approach of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to uncover behavioral structure from student logs in a MITx Massive Open Online Course, 8.02x: Electricity and Magnetism. LDA is typically found in the field of natural language processing, where it identifies the latent topic structure within a collection of documents. However, this framework can be adapted for analysis of user-behavioral patterns by considering user interactions with courseware as a ``bag of interactions'' equivalent to the ``bag of words'' model found in topic modeling. By employing this representation, LDA forms probabilistic use cases that clusters students based on their behavior. Through the probability distributions associated with each use case, this approach provides an interpretable representation of user access patterns, while reducing the dimensionality of the data and improving accuracy. Using only the first week of logs, we can predict whether or not a student will earn a certificate with 0.81 ± 0.01 cross-validation accuracy.

Researchers, educators, and the general public have recently become interested in how the learning experience in MOOCs differs from that in traditional courses. A major component of the learning experience is how students navigate through course content.This paper presents an empirical study of how students navigate through MOOCs, and is, to our knowledge, the first to investigate how navigation strategies differ by demographics such as age and country of origin. We performed data analysis on the activities of 140,546 students in four edX MOOCs and found that certificate earners skip on average 22% of the course content, that they frequently employ non-linear navigation by jumping backward to earlier lecture sequences, and that older students and those from countries with lower student-teacher ratios are more comprehensive and non-linear when navigating through the course.From these findings, we suggest design recommendations such as for MOOC platforms to develop more detailed forms of certification that incentivize students to deeply engage with the content rather than just doing the minimum necessary to earn a passing grade.

In recent years, a new research agenda has emerged, focusing on predicting and explaining dropouts and MOOCs with low completion rates. However, due to different problem specifications and evaluation metrics, performing learning analytics (LA) of online education is a challenging task. The online learner has a variety of purposes, such as complete learning courses, some knowledge points in work-based learning courses, selective learning for reviewing exams, certificate-based learning, and watching videos for interest. According to users'online behavior data, it is difficult to study why so many people drop out of MOOCs. Because users have many reasons, such as not understanding, bad network connection, other things to do, and so on. This paper study was performed to analyze data of students' online activity in a blended computer education course in Northwestern Polytechnical University (NPU) to identify quantitative markers that correlate with students' performance and might be used as early warning signs for possible data-driven measures.

Thousands of students with different social and cultural backgrounds from all over the world can enroll for a course. This diverse audience comes with varying motivations and intentions from their personal or professional life. However, course instructors cannot offer individual support and guidance at this scale and therefore usually provide a one-size-fits-all approach. Students have to follow weekly-structured courses and their success is measured with the achievement of a certificate at the end. To better address the varying learning needs, technical support for goal-oriented and self-regulated learning is desired but very limited to date. Both learning strategies are proven to be key factors for students' achievement in large-scale online learning environments. Therefore, this paper presents a continuative study of personalized learning objectives in MOOCs to encourage goal-oriented and self-regulated learning. Based on the previously well-perceived acceptance and usefulness of the concept of personalized learning objectives, this study examines which learners select an objective and how successful they complete objectives. Concerning the learners' socio-demographic and geographical background, we could not identify any practical significant difference between students with selected learning objectives and the total course population. However, we have identified promising objective achievement rates, and we have observed a practical significant improvement of the certification rates comparing the total course population and students who selected an objective that included a graded certificate.

Schreurs,MOOCs in universities: Intelligent model for delivering online learning content,2015,"A massive open online course (MOOC) is a model for delivering learning content online to any person who wants to take a course, with no conditions on attendance. Unlike traditional courses, MOOCs require additional skills, provided by videographers, instructional designers, IT specialists and platform specialists. Over the past few years several Universities facilitated partnership with MOOCs providers and are building MOOC courses, to serve as e-learning versions of their courses. Despite all the advantages offered by the MOOC courses, the current statistics show that only a very limited number of registered learners are completing the course. And the vast majority are stopping learning at an early stage. The main reason can be found in the lack of motivation of the students to pass the exams to become a certificate, because universities do not accept the certificates for credits. The aim of this paper is to study the readiness of students to take MOOC courses on one hand and the acceptance of MOOC courses in Universities. A study is conducted on two Universities, Hasselt University, Belgium and Princess Sumaya University for Technology, Jordan. The results of the study are promising, as they suggest that such virtual study programs are accepted in both Universities. However, professors in both Universities elucidate concerns on accepting the equivalence of the MOOC courses to their own courses.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7397216,2015 IEEE Seventh International Conference on Intelligent Computing and Information Systems (ICICIS),,,,,

On the other hand, there is a lot of movement towards micro-credentials, online master's degrees based on MOOCs, and formal MOOC degrees. However, what is the classic MOOC clientele actually doing with their certificates? What are the reasons why successful MOOC learners put a lot of time and effort in exams and exercises? Do employers accept these certificates in application portfolios? Do they allow their employees to participate in a MOOC during their working hours? Do they pay for the certificates? Are there any differences concerning gender because women are still in the minority in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) and their career paths often hit a plateau? These questions have been on our mind since we started offering courses on our MOOC platform in 2012. We have had anecdotal evidence, for example, that a participant was helped to get a new job with a certificate from one of our courses-yet this is ultimately just hearsay. Therefore, to find out what is really going on we conducted a survey among the 187,000 registered users of our platform.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9028698,2019 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE),,,,,

Olmos,A Learning Analytics Tool for Predictive Modeling of Dropout and Certificate Acquisition on MOOCs for Professional Learning,2018,"Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) appeared as a proper way to provide lifelong learning for potential learners of both professional and academic settings. Industry leaders can benefit from these courses because they foster the professional development of their employees in their industry. Despite these benefits, these online courses continue to register a high dropout rate and a vast number of their learners do not acquire the certificate provided at the completion of the course. This article proposes a predictive modeling tool with several Machine Learning algorithms (for generating Predictive Models) and feature engineering in MOOCs data integrated to contribute research to this specific issue. The proposed tool predicts two situations: which learners are likely to leave the course (dropout) and which learners are expected to pass the course (certificate acquisition). The tool was tested in fifteen deliveries of seven MOOCs. Initial results provide interesting information, for instance, that the accuracy of predicting certificate acquisition is higher than the precision of predicting dropout for all algorithms.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8607541,2018 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management (IEEM),,,,,

The grades students receive on these tests and assignments determine whether they complete or become certified in course material. However, beyond receiving a certification, how do grades impact the learning behavior in students? Do students who receive poor grades actively change their overall activity to improve their grades? To better understand the impact of grades, we observe overall student activity on two MITx MOOCs for certified students and students who continuously participate in MOOC assignments. We use click stream data to compile the overall activity of a student and we use points earned divided by total possible points to calculate the students' grades. We observe that students with the highest levels of activity have some of the highest grades. We also observe that the difference in activity before and after the finalization of a grade (delta-activity) have greater variation as grade increases. Finally, we observe very little changes in grades (delta-grade) for certified students when visualized against delta-activity and that continuously participating students have greater grade changes compared to certified students.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8939614,2019 IEEE Learning With MOOCS (LWMOOCS),,,,,

The current higher education system cannot satisfy this need in many fields, e.g. Gartner predicts, that already in 2015 only a third of jobs for big data analysts can be filled [2]. The rapid development of Information and Communication Technology (ITC, IT) has changed many aspects of teaching and learning. Educational materials are moving into cloud(s) and degrees are given on-line (`Master's Degree Online Directory' lists over 90,000 programs [3]), old-fashioned Colleges and Universities with large campus, staff and high costs are getting more and more competition from numerous educational entrepreneurs, who start massive open online courses (MOOC) with millions of users/students from all around the world; they establish new on-line universities where costs of obtaining a degree are marginal compared to `brick-and-mortal' universities and which are open to nearly everyone independent of user geographical location. Until now MOOC have not yet proved their value-less than 4% of enrollees complete the courses [4] and they do not receive (yet) university diploma. But the World most prestigious technical university, MIT, has already set up a certification system - students who can master the subjects taught in MOOC receive an official certificate of completion [5]. Although these certificates will not carry the weight of a traditional MIT diploma (they will be issued by started by MIT online learning initiative called MITx), but the word `MIT' alone carries a weight. When speaking about possibilities of IT in education most speakers/writers are excitedly discussing technology-servers, communication lines, bandwidth, security (preferably all in thick cloud of technical jargon). Nearly nobody presents practical experience, suggestions and/or theories about how to teach with this new technology in order best to utilize its possibilities. The `education in the cloud' mainly consists of video clips trying to repeat the classroom experience: recorded before the old-fashioned blackboard (only nowadays it is white), where professor is presenting the same lecture what he presented in lecture hall, only now lectures are cut into 5-10 min video clips - the `mobile approach'. Is this why the old lecture halls are still needed? Rapidly increasing costs of University Education, increasing competition of educational entrepreneurs and constant increase of population of working students have made clear, that both sides of University education - teaching/learning and accrediting, giving diplomas need changes. University Education should more take into account students informal and non-formal learning, their participation in professional work - both in organization of study and in certification.

Global Engineering is the last frontier in education. It creates a dilemma of providing engineering education anywhere in the World, preserving local cultural values, and applying it anywhere around the Globe. A recent Singapore Declaration [ASEE Global Forum, 2009], and consecutive World Engineering Education Forums, [1] paved the roadmap towards Global Engineering calling for practical solutions to implement the vision of a global engineer. In response to these challenges, several ‚Äúdisruptive innovation‚Äù [Christensen, 1995] solutions such as Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC) and Massive Open Online Laboratories (MOOL) have been introduced including the one based on the Internet of Things (IOT) and disruptive microelectronics [2]. Disruptive Microelectronics which includes embedded systems, Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC), Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA), and Programmable Systems On a Chip (PSOC), is one of excellent case studies of disruptive technologies (or disruptive innovation) which is defined as an innovation that helps create a new market and value network, and eventually goes on to disrupt an existing market and value network (over a few years or decades), displacing an earlier technology. The Internet of Things is the next generation of the Internet connecting objects, not just people. Since the ultimate goal is to produce new industries globally, understanding, measuring, evaluating, and preserving the integrity of global engineering becomes fundamental. The latter is proposed to be addressed by Quality Assessment (QA) of emerging global engineering curricula and scholars involved in teaching of global engineering. For example, International Society for Engineering Education (IGIP) is one of the leaders providing international certification of scholars and one of the frontrunners in fostering engineering on line, critical for global engineering. The overall process of global engineering education addressing essential skills for engineers from any country to be competitive in an international market for engineering knowhow, with skills not longer limited to cultural sensitivity needed only for product design destined for diverse markets can be superbly captured by Service Science [Spohrer, 2008]. Service science is an interdisciplinary paradigm to the study, design, and implementation of complex systems in which specific arrangements of people and technologies take actions that provide value for others [3].

This research effort addresses this problem by exploring course participants' attitudes and levels of acceptance of non-formal learning recognition compared to traditional university credit in both developed and developing countries. The actual study uses both certificates of completion and digital badges to recognize and validate learning in an introductory, university level course in web programming using HTML5/CSS. The course is available to anyone, but was specifically marketed to participants from Sweden and Kenya. Empirical data was gathered using interviews and online surveys in the course. The preliminary results are that participants from developing countries value digital recognition to a greater extent than their counterparts in Europe.

The MOOC (massively open online course) is said to be a ""game-changer"" by The New York Times.

These online courses are massive in scale enrolling thousands of students limited only by the technology. They are openly available at zero cost. However, some courses charge a minimum fee for the certification. The course is available online and so can be accessed remotely if there is an internet connection. They help in decentralizing the education system. This creates an internet of education. It also helps to overcome the cultural and social barriers that hindered people from accessing education. MOOCs will allow people to educate themselves based on what they want to learn. It gives them a wide range of topics to choose and learn. They can take advantage of the growing computer awareness and IT penetration. MOOCs are already a big hit in rural communities and developing countries where people don't have as much access to traditional schools and colleges. MOOCs are causing a massive shift in the way people learn and access education. In spite of these advantages, they have their share of disadvantages too. The technology is unreliable. There is a lack of interest among the governments to initiate the institutional change. Also the pace of implementation is a grave concern. People worry that this could lead to a one-way transfer of educational materials from the rich countries to the poor countries will amount to a wave of ""intellectual neo-colonialism."" Also, language is a major barrier to have a global reach. The emphasis shifts from the teacher to the teaching material. Students have to digest the information and learn by themselves. They review the content in isolation and try to learn without access to peers or professors. This makes it difficult to stay motivated. Students are also missing the traditional face-to-face interactions. Lastly, schools and employers do not take MOOCs seriously. Therefore, there is a mixed response from the educators.

Iyer,"LCM: A Model for Planning, Designing and Conducting Learner-Centric MOOCs",2018,"MOOCs are expanding in popularity and scope, and several new courses are being designed and implemented in a variety of contexts. The discussion around MOOCs is growing too, however, much of that is centered around technological or certification-related issues. There are still not many advances in the pedagogical format, and many MOOCs end up being an online version of the traditional lecture format. At the same time, several problems have been reported, such as, lack of learner engagement, low participation in forums and low completion rates. To address these challenges, we present the Learner-Centric MOOC model: a prescriptive model consisting of a set of guidelines, activity formats and actions for MOOC creators. The LCM model guides instructors in conceptualizing, creating and conducting a MOOC, while maintaining a learner-centric pedagogical approach at its core. The LCM model consists of four structural elements: Learning Dialogs, Learning by Doing activities, Learning Experience Interaction and Learning Extension Trajectories, and Orchestration dynamics. In this paper, we describe the structural and dynamic aspects of the LCM model, show its application in various MOOCs and illustrate evaluation results from MOOCs based on LCM model.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8590110,2018 IEEE Tenth International Conference on Technology for Education (T4E),,,,,

China University Love Course Platform can provide course certificates. At present, universities encourage teachers to teach MOOC courses, which promotes both the internationalization of higher education and the innovation of traditional teaching. However, there are several issues with the current MOOC teaching. First, there is an unbalanced low proportion of laboratory courses; Second, the offered laboratory courses mainly focus on theory, leading to the lack of experimental design and other teaching links; Third, the lack of some practical trainings, such as practical experiments and remote experiments, reduces teaching effects; Fourth, MOOC belongs to the network teaching mode. It is difficult for students to complete the MOOC course if it is not combined with offline course management,. To solve these issues, this paper designed an experiment on automatic control theory, which is a mixed teaching mode, namely the MOOC laboratory teaching + auxiliary Web online teaching platform + off-line laboratory teaching and management. It enables the students to not only take online MOOC content, also manage and download the study materials remotely.

Various types of analysis that can be done on the course text, video transcripts and assessments such as readability, listenability, videolytics, and text analysis. By analyzing the course content before its release, the content can be adjusted to target various learners. Subsequently, the same techniques can be used to analyze the discussion board posts and post-course survey to identify areas in a course that need to be modified in to order to improve the course quality for subsequent release.

Therefore, it is desired that alternative methods should be adopted to reduce the gap between the required number of qualified teachers and the actually available. As the technology is evolving rapidly, Massively Open Online Courses (MOOCs) appears to be an imminent concept which allows the students to use the IT infrastructure to learn while sitting at their home or workplace. MOOCs help the students to nurture problem-solving capabilities in them with the help of a plethora of online courses in diverse fields. Learners can choose courses of their interest and acquire a certificate of the same. This paper explores the concept and benefits of MOOCs in today's scenario, its advantages like freedom from geographic boundaries, flexibility, optimal cost, better educational outcomes. Further, this paper highlights challenges and limitations towards implementing MOOCs such as the dearth of infrastructure in developing countries, absence of proper assessment method, invalidity of such courses in conventional degree level programs, lack of practical sessions, and dropout rate. Significant developments in the field of MOOCs are ongoing in India under the banner of Ministry of Human Resource Development's project SWAYAM (Study Webs of Active-Learning for Young Aspiring Minds). Nature Journal survey has shown that India ranked second in the world to access MOOCs services. Indian Institute of Bombay and Indian Institute of Kharagpur started a program called T10KT (Train 10 Thousand (K) Teachers) to conduct large-scale teachers training and E-learning awareness program.

In this direction, the goal of this work is to predict whether a student will abandon a MOOC before completing it, so that it is possible to intervene accordingly, by warning the teacher about the dropout risk, notifying the student about this risk, etc. Different machine learning techniques have been tested with real data of a MOOC supported by EdX at UAM.

Bajnaid,Leveraging Linked Data to Propel Competency-Based Education Based on Labour Skills,2019,"Recently, there is a debate on the credentials that is more important for the individuals; their education and certificates or their competences and skills. Competency-based education (CBE) is a paradigm that can combine the both benefits. Linked data technology has potentials that help education to be more oriented towards CBE by linking the education with competences fields such as labour. However, that needs the education courses to be updated according to labours' demands which require lifelong learning to make individuals kept up with the emerging competences and technologies. CBE and lifelong learning are related to open education such as OCWs, MOOCs and OERs; since MOOCs for example give the chance to learn from the industry leaders which is very effective for CBE and can be acquired anytime. Also, open education is more responsive to the emerging demands of labour. Based on that, traditional universities have a possibility to update their courses based on the CBE rather than starting from scratch. Therefore, making mutual integration between traditional and open education courses based on labours' competences can offer an opportunity to go towards CBE. In this paper we propose a novel approach to refine education courses to be more oriented towards CBE by this mutuality integration. Input to this approach is the course information and the output is lists of candidate competences concepts that a course designer can use to refine current courses' topics and learning outcomes based on labour skills. Also developing a new metrics is suggested based on conducting some statistics to measure the importance of the concept regarding the CBE and measure how much the whole course is related to the labour needs. Lastly, developing a bridged model based on the competences concepts to be as anchors is suggested to provide links to the related OERs and related courses from MOOCS/OCWs.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8769503,2019 2nd International Conference on Computer Applications & Information Security (ICCAIS),,,,,

Through web platforms, universities and other institutions offer content and courses where any student can enroll. With this new approach, much knowledge that previously was only accessible to official students paying, in general, expensive fees, is now accessible to any citizen for free. In addition, institutions of higher education usually grant a certificate to students who passed the course. However, this divulgative and massive open approach also creates some distortions. In particular, the management of MOOC courses is a task of extreme complexity, due to the mixture of a large number of very different student profiles, and the combination of nonaligned interests. As a consequence, the dropout rate in these courses is higher than 70% in most courses. In any case, before proposing any solution, it is necessary to analyze and study the current situation in a systematic and scientific way. Therefore, this article describes an experience carried out jointly by professors from the Universidad Polit√©cnica de Madrid (UPM, Spain) and the University of Tras os Montes e Alto Douro (Portugal), based on the creation and teaching of a MOOC course focused on domotics and Arduino technologies, accessible on the MiriadaX platform.

This MOOC T√©cnico course related to electromagnetism differs from the remaining courses because it includes a strong laboratorial component which challenges students to understand and analyse experimental data collected during the course. With the present analysis, we intended to study the participants' background, understand what they aim to achieve by enrolling the course and how the nature of its contents and activities affects their overall success. In more detail, we determined how the inclusion of activities such as hands-on experiments, operation of remote laboratories and open questions with peer review evaluations affect the dropout rates and the evaluations obtained by the students. This information is crucial to tailor the course to the student's needs, ultimately improving the course quality and the student's learning experience. To achieve this, data regarding the students characteristics and the number of active participants for the different course stages was collected. The results showed a large participation of people from outside the T√©cnico Lisboa (IST) community (enrolled students, teachers, researchers, staff, alumni) and a high variety of academic paths inside it.

The model first automatically extracts the sentences with the high negative emotion density (NED), and then incorporates emotion and topic together to explore negative emotional feedbacks towards topics. The experimental results show that learners extended some negative comments towards the issues about learning content, online assignments and certificates of courses.

We developed a massive open online course (MOOC), The Science of Safety in Healthcare, to present the foundational patient safety principles to a broad global audience of health professionals, learners, and patients interested in patient safety. Objectives: To describe the Science of Safety in Healthcare MOOC, its effects on patient safety competence, and the satisfaction of course participants. Methods: The five-week video-based course was delivered in 2013 and 2014, and was organized in five modules: 1) overview of science of safety and safety culture, 2) enabling and contextual factors that influence patient safety and quality, 3) methods to improve safety and quality, 4) translating evidence intro practice and leading change, and 5) summary and opportunities for capacity building. Each module had three or four segments. Participants were introduced to key concepts, and tools and skills to promote patient safety. Participants completed the Health Professional Education in Patient Safety Survey (H-PEPSS), which measures patient safety competence, and a course satisfaction survey. Pre- and post- course H-PEPSS scores were compared using paired t-tests. Course satisfaction surveys were administered at the completion of the course and six months later. Results: A total of 20,957, and 9679 participants enrolled in the course in 2013 and 2014, respectively. About half of participants were 25–44 years old (57%), and female (54%). Participants joined from over 100 countries. The majority were health professionals (61%) or health professionals in training (7%). Mean H-PEPSS scores improved after course completion, with significant increases on all survey domains in both years (p < 0.01). Mean score differences were: Teamwork 0.68 (95% CI: 0.64, 0.71), Communication 0.70 (95% CI: 0.66, 0.73), Managing Risk 0.79 (95% CI: 0.76, 0.82), Human Environment 0.64 (95% CI: 0.61, 0.68), Recognizing and Responding 0.64 (95% CI: 0.61, 0.68), and Culture 0.72 (95% CI: 0.68, 0.75). About 8% of participants in each cohort earned a certificate of completion. At 6-months post-course, the majority of the participants agreed or agreed strongly that the course content was useful (93%) and that the course positively influenced their clinical practice (69%) and communication (84%). Conclusions: The MOOC course allowed educators to reach a large, diverse audience. The course was well-received and participants reported a significant increase in patient safety competence. As with most MOOCs, rates of completion were low. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85107053275&doi=10.1016%2fj.nedt.2021.104984&partnerID=40&md5=1b803e403e09390902c7a01bfce06d80,Nurse Education Today,Churchill Livingstone,,,,
Scopus,Conference Paper,"Liu Z., Mu R., Liu S., Peng X., Liu S.",Modeling Temporal Association of Cognition-Topic in MOOC Discussion to Track Learners' Cognitive Engagement Dynamics,2021,"In the discussion forums of massive open online courses (MOOCs), cognitive processing (e.g., insight, certain) is considered an essential factor that can affect learners' learning outcomes, but the relationship between them has not been thoroughly investigated. Especially the dynamic nature of cognitive processing is still a significant research gap. In this study, we proposed an unsupervised topic model named Temporal Cognitive Topic Model (TCTM) to automatically classify cognitive processes and obtain the conditional probability with topics over time. The results indicated that completers had more active and timely cognitive engagement as time went on and tended to use certain cognitive words to discuss the topics related to the examination and certificates, which showed that they had explicit learning goals and plans. Non-completers often used exclusive cognitive words to discuss some off-task content that pointed out a distractive learning process. Using the model, teachers can capture learners' dynamic cognitive states and associated topics to improve teaching methods and increase course completion rates. © 2021 Owner/Author.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85108119698&doi=10.1145%2f3430895.3460170&partnerID=40&md5=467cf8e0556b0bfa39fdee9c22218d3c,L@S 2021 - Proceedings of the 8th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","8th Annual ACM Conference on Learning at Scale, L@S 2021",,,
Scopus,Article,"Alshehri M., Alamri A., Cristea A.I., Stewart C.D.",Towards Designing Profitable Courses: Predicting Student Purchasing Behaviour in MOOCs,2021,"Since their ‘official’ emergence in 2012 (Gardner and Brooks 2018), massive open online courses (MOOCs) have been growing rapidly. They offer low-cost education for both students and content providers; however, currently there is a very low level of course purchasing (less than 1% of the total number of enrolled students on a given online course opt to purchase its certificate). The most recent literature on MOOCs focuses on identifying factors that contribute to student success, completion level and engagement. One of the MOOC platforms’ ultimate targets is to become self-sustaining, enabling partners to create revenues and offset operating costs. Nevertheless, analysing learners’ purchasing behaviour on MOOCs remains limited. Thus, this study aims to predict students purchasing behaviour and therefore a MOOCs revenue, based on the rich array of activity clickstream and demographic data from learners. Specifically, we compare how several machine learning algorithms, namely RandomForest, GradientBoosting, AdaBoost and XGBoost can predict course purchasability using a large-scale data collection of 23 runs spread over 5 courses delivered by The University of Warwick between 2013 and 2017 via FutureLearn. We further identify the common representative predictive attributes that influence a learner’s certificate purchasing decisions. Our proposed model achieved promising accuracies, between 0.82 and 0.91, using only the time spent on each step. We further reached higher accuracy of 0.83 to 0.95, adding learner demographics (e.g. gender, age group, level of education, and country) which showed a considerable impact on the model’s performance. The outcomes of this study are expected to help design future courses and predict the profitability of future runs; it may also help determine what personalisation features could be provided to increase MOOC revenue. © 2021, The Author(s).",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85103185364&doi=10.1007%2fs40593-021-00246-2&partnerID=40&md5=ca8b0f62791896d2de0adc783021a552,International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education,Springer,,,,

There are three ways for students to earn their credits, namely take the subject course in face-to-face based class, virtual based class or under Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). MOOCs is a model that is developed to help people to learn about certain skills through the online platform, without any limitation in the audience. MOOCs aim to enhance broad collaboration between individuals in creating learning environments that have high scalability and can be accessed by anyone and anywhere. The complexity arises when students undertake a subject course through MOOCs, how to certify the completion of their program in which the certification can be gained easily, and the last how secure the obtained certificate? Blockchain technology can help to improve the quality of MOOCs by providing control of academic records as evidence that someone has completed a learning process on MOOCs.

This paper draws on theWorld Health Organization (WHO)'s experience of COVID-19 knowledge-transfer to a worldwide audience of millions of learners registered on OpenWHO, WHO's massive open online course platform. It aims to illustrate the technological solutions that WHO, in collaboration with the Hasso Plattner Institute (HPI), OpenWHO's platform provider, employed in response to the unique challenges this surge in demand for learning engendered. Data on OpenWHO use, including geographic patterns and certificate attainment, were extracted from OpenWHO's internal and external reporting systems. Descriptive analysis was employed to identify trends and compare OpenWHO use with COVID-19 caseload in each WHO region. Data on the OpenWHO system load were obtained from the OpenWHO load balancer (HAProxy). The OpenWHO team responded to the need for trustworthy, evidence-based knowledge on COVID-19 via three main avenues: increased scale, targeting the needs of affected and underserved communities, and prioritising multilingualism. Each approach brought novel problems, which WHO and HPI leveraged their collaboration to meet by employing technology. This included increasing server bandwidth, expanding support teams, adding new language capabilities, and deploying functions to streamline workflows and boost learner experience. In doing so, the ability to effectively and efficiently harness technology became a critical step towards empowering learning's life-saving potential during the COVID-19 pandemic. © 14th International Conference on ICT, Society, and Human Beings, ICT 2021, 18th International Conference on Web Based Communities and Social Media, WBC 2021 and 13th International Conference on e-Health, EH 2021 - Held at the 15th Multi-Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems, MCCSIS 2021.

The concept is based on the combination of new technologies and teaching methods in order to create new ideas and innovations that can enhance learning for modern learners and, at the same time, respond directly to their learning experiences. Thus, instructors are responsible for organizing the environment and creating learner-friendly learning materials using existing technology, which can lead to a digital university learning society. The contributions of this article are: 1) to synthesize the conceptual framework of the SDL MOOCs model, 2) to develop the SDL MOOCs model, 3) to develop instructional processes with self-directed learning to enhance digital literacy skills (SDL process), and 4) to study the results of developing the SDL MOOCs model. The suitability of the SDL MOOCs model was assessed by 15 experts with extensive experience in the fields of online education design and development, computer science and information and communication technologies for education. The results of this research show that: 1) the SDL MOOCs model consists of 4 main elements (input factors, instructional process, output, and feedback), 2) the SDL process consists of 4 stages (preparation, web-based self-directed learning, post-testing, and certificate approval), and 3) the developmental adequacy of the SDL MOOCs model is at a very high level. © 2021 Kassel University Press GmbH.

Although students from all over the globe register for MOOCs, only a small proportion of participants complete the online courses. MOOCs at present encounter the problem of low retention rates, thus providing numerous research gaps. This paper investigates the impact of critical factors such as the instructor’s role, course relevancy, learning outcomes on MOOCs retention. This study also analyzes the mediating role of IT (Social Media) between critical factors and MOOCs retention and provides feasible solutions for the improvement of MOOCs retention rates. Data were collected from Pakistani participants who attended, registered, or completed any MOOC. The findings of this study indicate that critical factors such as the instructor’s role, course relevancy, learning outcomes have a positive impact on MOOC participants’ retention. The results also confirm the important mediating role of IT (Social Media). The universities and the instructors who offer MOOCs should consider these critical factors when offering an online course.

Although retention and completion rates for nonpaying users have not been promising, these statistics are much brighter for users who pay to receive a certificate upon completing the course. We investigate whether paying for the certificate option can increase engagement with course content. In particular, we consider two effects: (1) the certificate effect, which is the boost in motivation to stay engaged to receive the certificate; and (2) the sunk-cost effect, which arises solely because the user paid for the course. We use data from over 70 courses offered on the Coursera platform and study the engagement of individual participants at different milestones within each course. The panel nature of the data enables us to include controls for intrinsic differences between nonpaying and paying users in terms of their desire to stay engaged. We find evidence that the certificate and sunk-cost effects increase user engagement by approximately 8%–9% and 17%–20%, respectively. Whereas the sunk-cost effect is transient and lasts for only a few weeks after payment, the certificate effect lasts until the participant reaches the grade required to be eligible to receive the certificate. We discuss the implications of our findings for how platforms and content creators may design course milestones and schedule payment of course fees. Given that greater engagement tends to improve learning outcomes, our study serves as an important first step in understanding the role of prices and payment in enabling MOOCs to realize their full potential. © American Marketing Association 2021.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85116068116&doi=10.1177%2f00222437211016360&partnerID=40&md5=fe900fec07d2ecfc47db2e7a53d2897d,Journal of Marketing Research,SAGE Publications Ltd,,,,

We observe that the field of study and the characteristics of the institution providing the course play a role. We explain these results by the heterogeneity in preferences and peer recognition with regard to open practices.

This requires sharing a common core of knowledge to facilitate collaboration between them. To date, training in geriatric oncology has been limited in scope and difficult to access for caregivers, particularly nurses and healthcare aides. To meet this need, a massive open online course (MOOC), in geriatric oncology has been developed in France. This kind of course aims to provide simultaneous access for a large number of participants and to foster communication with the pedagogical team through discussion forums. The first session of the MOOC, which has been set up in the Occitania region of France, went online nationwide from March 6 to June 23, 2020. Despite the SARS CoV-2 global health crisis, 1020 people subscribed to the first session and 417 (40.9%) were certified at the end of the course. Most are nurses (35.2%) and work outside Occitania (56.3%). A survey revealed a high satisfaction level regarding relevance of lessons (97.9%), pedagogical quality of teaching team (97.9%), knowledge acquisition (93.6%), meeting learners' needs (90.4%) and practical value of the course (88.3%).

These platforms also bring incredible diversity of learners in terms of their traits. A research area called Author Profiling (AP in general; here, Learner Profiling (LP)), is to identify such traits about learners, which is vital in MOOCs for, e.g., preventing plagiarism, or eligibility for course certification. Identifying a learner’s trait in a MOOC is notoriously hard to do from textual content alone. We argue that to predict a learner’s academic level, we need to also be using other features stemming from MOOC platforms, such as derived from learners’ actions on the platform. In this study, we specifically examine time stamps, quizzes, and discussions.

However, currently there is a very low level of course purchasing (less than 1% of the total number of enrolled students on a given online course opt to purchase its certificate). This can impact seriously the business model of MOOCs. Nevertheless, MOOC research on learners’ purchasing behaviour on MOOCs remains limited. Thus, the umbrella question that this work tackles is if learner’s data can predict their purchasing decision (certification). Our fine-grained analysis attempts to uncover the latent correlation between learner activities and their decision to purchase. We used a relatively large dataset of 5 courses of 23 runs obtained from the less studied MOOC platform of FutureLearn to: (1) statistically compare the activities of non-paying learners with course purchasers, (2) predict course certification using different classifiers, optimising for this naturally strongly imbalanced dataset. Our results show that learner activities are good predictors of course purchasibility; still, the main challenge was that of early prediction. Using only student number of step accesses, attempts, correct and wrong answers, our model achieve promising accuracies, ranging between 0.81 and 0.95 across the five courses. The outcomes of this study are expected to help design future courses and predict the profitability of future runs; it may also help determine what personalisation features could be provided to increase MOOC revenue. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85112268365&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-80421-3_20&partnerID=40&md5=ad80a7b375dd53bac187b1f6f2f5c1ca,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,"17th International Conference on Intelligent Tutoring Systems, ITS 2021",,,

In the last decade, distance technologies (including the format of massive open online courses - MOOCs) have occupied an increasingly significant place in the higher education system. The sphere of teaching foreign languages, in particular, Russian as a foreign language (RFL), is no exception. Currently, knowledge of the basics of modern distance educational technologies and the ability to apply them in the educational process is the most important component of the RFL teacher's professiogram. The purpose of this study is to assess the level of readiness of RFL teachers to use existing MOOCs and create their own online courses. Materials and research methods. An analysis of the regulatory framework for professional certification of higher education teachers and an analysis of scientific sources devoted to the content of the ICT competence of an RFL teacher are applied. The survey involved 50 RFL teachers from various universities in St. Petersburg. Research results. It was found that there is a significant gap between the required content of the RFL teacher's professiogram in the field of ICT competence and the level of readiness of RFL teachers to use ready-made MOOCs and create their own online courses. Only 11% of those surveyed used MOOCs in their professional activities, and only 38% themselves studied with the help of such courses. 42% and 52% of respondents are ready to use ready-made MOOCs and create their own courses, respectively. The effectiveness of MOOCs in teaching RFL is rated highly by only 37% of respondents, another 34% rate it as average and 29% as low. Discussion of results and conclusion. The existence of this gap is explained by the fact that the professional training of RFL teachers in the field of ICT competence does not always keep pace with the changes in the field of modern educational technologies. In addition, not all teachers see the expediency of using MOOCs in the process of teaching RFL, since language learning requires communication practice, and MOOCs are more often used to convey the theoretical aspects of a particular discipline. Despite this, many RFL teachers have shown an active desire to use ready-made online courses and create their own, subject to the passage of appropriate training, the availability of information and technical support for specialists in online education, as well as material and legal support from the university administration. © 2020 LLC Ecological Help.

This mixed-methods study addresses this question by examining one of the first MOOC-based blended professional degree programs, which admitted students to an accelerated residential master's program on the basis of performance in MOOCs and a proctored exam. We found that male students and students with master's degrees were more likely to complete the online program and the blended program had more male students and more students with master's degrees than students in the existing residential program. Students who enrolled in the blended graduate program earned higher average grades than students in the residential program earned in their in-person courses (3.86 vs 3.75, p <.01).

This attracts a large number of learners, each with their own individual intentions and motivations to join a course. However, personal support and guidance can almost never be provided at this scale. All learners have to follow the same usually weekly structured content and the learning success is only measured by the achievement of a certificate. To overcome this one-size-fits-all approach with technical means, we introduced a tool for Personalized Learning Objectives. This enables learners to achieve more individual objectives in courses, follow different learning paths, and link their motivations and intentions to the definition of learning success. Previous studies have already examined, among other aspects, the usefulness, acceptance, and achievement rates of learning objectives in MOOCs. In this complimentary research, the satisfaction of students with and without a selected learning objective is compared in a course on topics from the field of Design Thinking. © 2020 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85097165094&doi=10.1109%2fLWMOOCS50143.2020.9234349&partnerID=40&md5=0a7371d0b1a7fda1df2f0ba84c033c0a,"Proceedings of 2020 IEEE Learning With MOOCS, LWMOOCS 2020",Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"2020 IEEE Learning With MOOCS, LWMOOCS 2020",,,

Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative–quantitative study of correlational and descriptive scope is carried out on two instruments based on pre- and post-tests of 6,029 participants, which is followed by a qualitative data analysis distributed by code families to identify participants’ main motivations to take MOOCs. Findings: The results showed a positive moderate-high correlation between expectancy-value and achievement goals, which means in a practical sense that the participants’ subjective estimates of the possibility of reaching their goals prior to the beginning of the course were fulfilled, as the intentionality of the subjects-participants was positive with respect to the contents imparted. Practical implications: The profiles of participants with a higher tendency to successfully finish the course and with high rates of engagement share the following characteristics: having previously and successfully finished more than one MOOC; taking the MOOC for work purposes (promotion, seeking better job opportunities, etc.); and having intrinsic motivation, that is, not depending on external factors such as obligations and certifications. Originality/value: This research suggests that there are pre-educational factors that define the trend of successful completion of MOOCs, based on expectancy-value (e.g. previous experiences with other MOOCs) and achievement goals (e.g. job improvement), with external motivational issues such as completion certificates being less prevalent in the learning intention. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85087864674&doi=10.1108%2fITSE-01-2020-0017&partnerID=40&md5=68aa212af707912585db64f2a3d98518,Interactive Technology and Smart Education,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,,,,

Design/methodology/approach: The primary data were collected from the field surveys conducted in the universities and academic institutions located in National Capital Region of Delhi, India, using convenience sampling technique. Structural equation modelling was used to test the hypothesized relationships in the proposed model. Findings: The findings indicate that the learners’ intention to adopt MOOCs is significantly influenced by intrinsic motivation, social recognition, perceived value and perceived usefulness. On the other hand, the personal readiness, self-regulation of learners and peer influence are not found to have any significant impact on MOOCs adoption intention. Practical implications: The findings of the study will be helpful for MOOCs providers and other stakeholders. The MOOCs providers should emphasize on providing courses from renowned universities in cutting-edge areas which are self-paced and cost-effective. The academic institutions should provide credit benefits to the students in lieu of completing courses through MOOCs. Likewise, employers should also recognize the certificates awarded by MOOCs and give due credit to the learners who complete such certifications. Originality/value: The study has contributed to the existing literature on MOOCs adoption by combining constructs from TUE and SDT. To the best of the author’s knowledge, this has been a first attempt to combine these two frameworks to study the learners’ adoption behaviour for MOOCs in Indian context. The integration of these two frameworks provides a more comprehensive model of factors with increased explanatory ability (72.6 per cent) to describe the adoption intention of MOOCs. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85087083428&doi=10.1108%2fITSE-06-2019-0033&partnerID=40&md5=a15593f4bf137b8088806ae47f713a7a,Interactive Technology and Smart Education,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,,,,

Thousands of students with different social and cultural backgrounds from all over the world can enroll for a course. This diverse audience comes with varying motivations and intentions from their personal or professional life. However, course instructors cannot offer individual support and guidance at this scale and therefore usually provide a one-size-fits-all approach. Students have to follow weekly-structured courses and their success is measured with the achievement of a certificate at the end. To better address the varying learning needs, technical support for goal-oriented and self-regulated learning is desired but very limited to date. Both learning strategies are proven to be key factors for students' achievement in large-scale online learning environments. Therefore, this paper presents a continuative study of personalized learning objectives in MOOCs to encourage goal-oriented and self-regulated learning. Based on the previously well-perceived acceptance and usefulness of the concept of personalized learning objectives, this study examines which learners select an objective and how successful they complete objectives. Concerning the learners' socio-demographic and geographical background, we could not identify any practical significant difference between students with selected learning objectives and the total course population. However, we have identified promising objective achievement rates, and we have observed a practical significant improvement of the certification rates comparing the total course population and students who selected an objective that included a graded certificate. This has also demonstrated a method for calculating more reasonable completion rates in MOOCs. © 2020 ACM.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85094875675&doi=10.1145%2f3386527.3405918&partnerID=40&md5=8eb5a772178bd7495d5b454bcff5ad00,L@S 2020 - Proceedings of the 7th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,Association for Computing Machinery,"7th Annual ACM Conference on Learning at Scale, L@S 2020",,,

The results show that students who start earlier and those who finish earlier the course obtain better grades in some of the modules (motivation and background on natural risks could be the explanation). However, for 'last moment students', speed in passing the modules is either related to greater motivation, although in this case it is not related to better grades. Furthermore, students who complete tasks during the weekend take less time to complete the modules and obtain a better grade. In addition, a learning strategy is promoted by reconsidering who is learning: players (those who complete the course and earning a certificate), auditors (those who have completed a thematic unit or the whole module, earning partial knowledge), and spectators (those enrolled until the end of the course, who intend earning experience in e-learning). © 2020 by the authors.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85087701288&doi=10.3390%2fSU12124878&partnerID=40&md5=7d4247f8e64a610a5f430a37c430d070,Sustainability (Switzerland),MDPI,,,,

To advance our understanding of how people learn in MOOCs, we investigate the intersection between learning design and the temporal process of engagement in the course. This study investigates the detailed processes of engagement using educational process mining in a FutureLearn science course (N = 2086 learners) and applying an established taxonomy of learning design to classify learning activities. The analyses were performed on three groups of learners categorised based upon their clicking behaviour. The process-mining results show at least one dominant pathway in each of the three groups, though multiple popular additional pathways were identified within each group. All three groups remained interested and engaged in the various learning and assessment activities. The findings from this study suggest that in the analysis of voluminous MOOC data there is value in first clustering learners and then investigating detailed progressions within each cluster that take the order and type of learning activities into account. The approach is promising because it provides insight into variation in behavioural sequences based on learners’ intentions for earning a course certificate. These insights can inform the targeting of analytics-based interventions to support learners and inform MOOC designers about adapting learning activities to different groups of learners based on their goals. © 2019, The Author(s).",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85067870663&doi=10.1007%2fs12528-019-09231-0&partnerID=40&md5=c233d6c6caea62947259291b31f7c8f7,Journal of Computing in Higher Education,Springer,,,,
Scopus,Article,Danka I.,Motivation by gamification: Adapting motivational tools of massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) for peer-to-peer assessment in connectivist massive open online courses (cMOOCs),2020,"In the first decade of the 21st century, distance learning (usually subject to course fees and resulting in formal certification) was complemented by free-of-charge open learning courses with unlimited numbers of participants and no final certificate. Termed massive open online courses (MOOCs), these soon fell into different categories, depending on their concept. Among them are connectivist massive open online courses (cMOOCs) which emphasise a collaborative approach to learning. However, while initial enrolment is indeed massive, completion rates are very low and cMOOCs notoriously lack an appropriate method of evaluating learning progress and motivational resources. The author of this article suggests that one way of addressing this problem might be to adapt motivational formative assessment tools used in massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) to cMOOCs. He argues that some characteristics of MMORPGs can be effectively incorporated in cMOOCs, thus benefiting from the motivational potential of MMORPGs. He cautions, however, that even if MMORPGs (and ongoing, low-stakes formative assessment in general) are motivational, they can only be applied to cMOOCs if the idea of formative assessment is not in tension with connectivist principles. Hence, the author argues for their compatibility, and builds on peer-to-peer assessment as a solution for resource allocation problems with low instructor–learner ratio. © 2020, The Author(s).",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85080990855&doi=10.1007%2fs11159-020-09821-6&partnerID=40&md5=c7fba6c68902a15b854b0271ce4f17d0,International Review of Education,Springer,,,,

It also endeavours to stimulate lifelong learning which would transform learners' lives and contribute to their continuing success. The Covid-19 pandemic has pushed all UK universities to online learning and assessment since March 2020. Accordingly, e-learning is becoming increasingly more important and is likely to maintain high levels of adoption in future. LinkedIn Learning (LiL), became a subsidiary of LinkedIn, the world's largest professional network, after it acquired Lynda.com in 2016. It is an e-learning platform offering over 15,000 Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) delivered by industry experts in 7 languages. It is accompanied by exercise files and assessments, and transcripts for the video. A completion certificate for a LiL course will be posted on the learner's LinkedIn profile if they or their institution have a subscription to LiL. Aligned with the aim of UK higher education, LiL is designed to help learners enrich their learning, better their careers and support lifelong learning. Accordingly, LiL has become a popular MOOCs e-learning portal and been widely adopted by UK Higher Education Institutions (HEIs). This paper reports ten 2nd year Master's students LiL experiences on an Advanced Business Research module in a UK HEI. LiL was used as a blended learning tool and formed part of the module's summative assessment. The embedded LiL courses corresponded to the module content and focused on technical tools and software applications widely applied in business research. They include Endnote reference management software, Survey Monkey and Microsoft Forms for online survey design, SPSS for quantitative data analysis and NVivo for qualitative data analysis. In this paper, 10 students' reflective portfolios on their completed LiL courses were analysed within NVivo. Constant comparative analysis was employed within a three-stage coding process in order to generate grounded theories. Results demonstrate students' positive e-learning experience and perceived LiL benefits in enhancing their research skills and employability. This research implies that LiL MOOCs could be used as an effective e-learning educational platform and blended learning pedagogy under the current Covid-19 pandemic situation and in the future. © 2020 Academic Conferences Limited.

The purpose of the article is twofold. On the one hand, to describe the evaluation system implemented during three editions in the MOOC ""Digital Literacy for groups at risk of social exclusion: Strategies for Socio-educational Intervention."" (European Project ECO). On the other hand, we analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the assessment system described. We have designed the evaluative model as a central and dynamic part of pedagogical design, allowing us to know our virtual participants (initial evaluation), to tutor their work and to evaluate their results (assesment of learning processes) and, finally, to obtain information in order to take decisions for improvement in each new edition (evaluation oriented to improvement). First of all, we describe the evaluation model. Then we analyze the main data collected with the tools used (initial questionnaire, interactions in Facebook groups and other social spaces, self-evaluation questionnaires, peer to peer evaluation, key informants and platform data). Finally, we discuss the results obtained in order to provide reflections that can guide the design of evaluation processes in MOOC. The main thesis we defend is that the planning of the evaluative model is a central element that must be outlined from minute one and be fully integrated with the rest of elements of the pedagogical design. Evaluative model should contemplate strategies for the initial and formative assessment of the participants and of the teaching-learning process itself, and not only be based on the final assessment oriented towards certification. © 2020 Grupo de Investigacion FORCE.

Even though they provide several benefits, there are still some criticisms of MOOCs. For instance, MOOCs' high dropout rates or predominantly elite participation are considered to be important problems. In order to develop solutions for these problems, a deeper understanding of MOOCs is required. Today, despite the availability of several research studies about MOOCs, there is a shortage of in-depth research on course characteristics, learner characteristics, and predictors of certification rates. This study examined MOOC and learner characteristics in detail and explored the predictors of course certification rates based on data from 122 Massachusetts Institute of Technology MOOCs (MITx) on edX platform as well as data about the 2.8 million participants registered in these MOOCs. The results indicated that as the number of courses offered and the number of learners enrolled increased in years, there was a decrease in the certification rates among enrolled learners. According to our results, the number of average chapters completed, total forum messages, and mean age predicted course certification rates positively. On the other hand, the total number of chapters in a course predicted the course certification rates negatively. Based on these results, shorter and more interactive MOOCs are recommended by considering the needs of the learners, course content design, and strategies encouraging the enrolled students to enter the courses. © 2020, Athabasca University.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85090973313&partnerID=40&md5=3c59b9fa9fd2069efee279fd1204fc4e,International Review of Research in Open and Distance Learning,Athabasca University,,,,

Scopus,Conference Paper,"Naji K., Ibriz A.",Adaptive MOOC Supports the Elicitation of Learners’ Preferences,2020,"Given higher education in Morocco suffers from the increasing number of students in institutions with open access policy, the issue of language and communication, the heterogeneous academic level of students, the inability to adapt schedules for students, the evolution of new technologies, etc., innovative pedagogy has become a necessity to address these challenges. Additionally, new modes of adaptive learning need to be designed to develop innovative training programs. Many authors agree that “innovation in pedagogy concerns everything that is not part of formal education” (Lison et al. 2014). In 2016, the Ministry of National Education, Vocational Training, Higher Education and Scientific Research in collaboration with GIP FUN MOOC, and the French Embassy signed an agreement to establish a platform MUN “Morocco Digital University”. The purpose of the agreement is to encourage Moroccan Universities to develop Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), Small Private Online Courses (SPOCs), and other forms of online courses and to reinforce partnership with French Universities in e-learning. MOOCs were developed in 2008, and after four years of operation, the New York Times considered 2012 “The year of the MOOC”. Since then, new features of MOOCs have motivated decision makers in higher education from across the world to create a number of online courses in their institutions. However, the weakness of MOOCs as a pedagogical innovation is the high dropout rate. Despite being massive courses, of thousands of enrollees, 50% quit after one week, 10% finish the course after completing all the modules, and only 4% obtain a certificate (Perna et al, Life Cycle of a Million MOOC Users. MOOC Research Initiative.Arlington, Texas, 2013). Given MOOCs are large-scale learning platforms that have failed to meet learners’ individual needs, considering this innovative pedagogy effective enough is conditional on adapting instruction to enhance student learning, learner’s characteristics, for example, knowledge or personal interests. In fact, why not implement adaptive learning techniques to further customize MOOCs? The purpose of this study is twofold. First, it aims to uncover the feasibility of adaptive learning on MOOCs in higher education in Morocco. Second, this investigation seeks to address the effects of adaptive learning on student learning outcomes, student engagement, and drop-out rates. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85078461595&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-36653-7_6&partnerID=40&md5=2bd00e530bc7292c7ad0a8644a7acd99,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,"2nd International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Systems for Sustainable Development, AI2SD 2019",,,

Provided that effort is closely linked to time, previous research has found a positive relationship between student effort over time and student success, both in university education and Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). With the complex environment of tracing and identifying relevant data of student learning processes in MOOCs, this study employs learning analytics to examine this relationship for MITx 6.00x, an introductory programming and computer science MOOC hosted on the edX MOOC platform. A population sample from the MOOC (N = 32,621) was examined using logistic regression, controlling for variables that may also influence the outcome. Conversely, the outcome of this research study suggests that there is a curvilinear relationship between effort over time and student success, meaning those who exert effort for the longest amount of time in the MOOC actually have a lower probability of obtaining a certificate than others who exert effort over somewhat less time.

Scopus,Article,Kumar K.,A study of Veterinary Scholars’ Perception of MOOCs,2019,"Purpose: Massive open online courses (MOOCs) are a currently trending e-learning platform that presumably attract thousands of participants because of boundless participation, are open to any person to enroll, are free to begin and are delivered completely online, thus contradicting the spatial limitations of a traditional classroom. This study aims to present the findings of a study among veterinary science students examining their perceptions of MOOCs. In total, 200 participants were randomly selected for the survey, out of which 177 responded, owing to a response rate of 88.7 per cent. Majority of the respondents (93 per cent) opined MOOCs supplement other learning methods and provide lifelong opportunity. A study report established that Coursera is the largest platform by user base (82 per cent), followed by Udemy (70 per cent), and 65 per cent knowledge seekers ranted the enormous propaganda about MOOCs are not because of the technology’s inherent edifying value, but because of the incredible potentials of lower costs. The participants in this survey valued their course and overall MOOC experience pleasing. Design/methodology/approach: The aim of the study is to explore veterinary students’ perception of MOOCs featuring in their subject of interest. The questionnaire was written in English because it is the teaching language for undergraduates and postgraduates in most Indian higher education institutes, including the one used as a context for this study. The online questionnaires were electronically mailed to a sample of veterinary students (undergraduate and postgraduate) with a consent form seeking their permission for participation in this study and swearing them the confidentiality of their responses. The e-mail included information about the purpose of the study as well as the URL to the survey site, demographic questions on age, gender and education. This part was followed by an important research question asking if the student had heard about the new open online educational system (MOOCs) provided in websites, including Coursera, Edx, Udacity and FutureLearn, among others. Based on respondents’ answers, they were directed to different sections. Students who knew about MOOCs were asked various mode of getting enrolled in MOOCs. If they were not enrolled in any course, the respondents were asked about the limitations to their use. Enrolled students were questioned on their perspectives and experiences with MOOCs. For students who gained certificates, were enquired for their level of satisfaction, opinions about the integration of MOOCs into the veterinary field and hindrances encountered during accessing the course. Out of a total of 200 students who initially agreed to take part, 177 responses were received, with a response rate of 88.50 per cent, with no cases of missing data. The data were stored automatically in the hosted online survey service into a separate database after the submission of the responses. The descriptive data analyses (such as average) were led using the data analysis tool provided. Findings: Even though most MOOCs do not provide academic credit or result in a degree, some of the biggest beneficiaries of MOOCs are students formally enrolled in an academic program, are provided a free mode to obtain additional academic assistance that would not otherwise be available (Parke Muth, 2018)15. Correspondingly, 93 per cent of the students opined MOOCs supplement other learning methods and provide lifelong opportunity. Learning has traditionally cost both money and time. With MOOCs, it now just costs time. In total, 24 per cent of the participants have discoursed free of cost as one of the intentions to choose their course. Almost every respondent (99 per cent) was interested toward online discussion forum, and 91 per cent preferred course materials containing video and audio files were pretty beneficial, while 88 per cent felt teaching through electronic whiteboard was the most advantageous criterion in their course. The study findings indicated that Coursera is the largest platform by user base (82 per cent), followed by Udemy (70 per cent). Research limitations/implications: The study considered veterinary science undergraduate (BVSc) and postgraduate (MVSc) students alone, veterinary faculties are not included for the survey. There was comparatively less participation of respondents who enrolled or successfully completed a MOOC, which makes the analysis of limitations and satisfaction less reliable. Hence, the study results cannot be generalized as a comprehensive report of veterinary science scholars’ perceptiveness. Originality/value: Animal health involves household pets and their care, in addition to livestock health and protection from diseases like bovine babesiosis, bovine tuberculosis and heartwater. There are numerous MOOCs offering online, contact or blended interventions in veterinary science and animal health that afford professionals quick and easy options to obtain credentials, including courses in pharmacology and toxicology, practice management, veterinary and para-veterinary studies, veterinary tropical diseases, radiology and wildlife management. As it is necessary to gain an understanding of the veterinary students’ level of familiarity and their insight toward the MOOC concept, the study attempts to explore their knowledge through an online survey. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85076049110&doi=10.1108%2fILS-04-2019-0031&partnerID=40&md5=7efa0d7e304f36e3a2105a9e4d6e4e0a,Information and Learning Science,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,,,,

Online educational pattern, both inside and outside of the campus community, have been become more popular. In recent years, a new research agenda has emerged, focusing on predicting and explaining dropouts and MOOCs with low completion rates. However, due to different problem specifications and evaluation metrics, performing learning analytics (LA) of online education is a challenging task. The online learner has a variety of purposes, such as complete learning courses, some knowledge points in work-based learning courses, selective learning for reviewing exams, certificate-based learning, and watching videos for interest. According to users'online behavior data, it is difficult to study why so many people drop out of MOOCs. Because users have many reasons, such as not understanding, bad network connection, other things to do, and so on. This paper study was performed to analyze data of students' online activity in a blended computer education course in Northwestern Polytechnical University (NPU) to identify quantitative markers that correlate with students' performance and might be used as early warning signs for possible data-driven measures.

The research was conducted in a cohort-based astronomy MOOC ""Astronomy: Exploring Time and Space"" provided through the Coursera platform. In order to discern motivations of course participants, the Science Motivation Questionnaire II was administered as a first assignment of the course. The survey data were collected from December 2016 until December 2018 and responses from 3701 learners were acquired. In order to determine the relationship of motivation to course performance, four course engagement indicators are defined: course completion, use of video lectures, participation in the discussion forums, and participation in peer-grading assignments. Self-determination and self-efficacy are identified as the main motivational factors influencing all aspects of the course engagement except for the video usage. We show that both of these decrease with age, but increase with the number of previously taken science courses. The main reasons for signing up for the course which had an effect on course engagement were the goal of getting a certificate and perceived importance of the reputation of the instructor. There was no statistically significant difference in motivations between people who dropped after the first peer graded writing assignment and those who successfully completed the course, suggesting that after the first writing assignment learners quit from other reasons than lack of motivation. Unexpectedly, learners with high career, grade, and social motivation watched statistically significantly fewer instructional videos, and social motivation did not play a role in the forum usage. © 2019 authors.

We often hear about the high dropout rates in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). On the other hand, there is a lot of movement towards micro-credentials, online master's degrees based on MOOCs, and formal MOOC degrees. However, what is the classic MOOC clientele actually doing with their certificates? What are the reasons why successful MOOC learners put a lot of time and effort in exams and exercises? Do employers accept these certificates in application portfolios? Do they allow their employees to participate in a MOOC during their working hours? Do they pay for the certificates? Are there any differences concerning gender because women are still in the minority in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) and their career paths often hit a plateau? These questions have been on our mind since we started offering courses on our MOOC platform in 2012. We have had anecdotal evidence, for example, that a participant was helped to get a new job with a certificate from one of our courses - yet this is ultimately just hearsay.

The grades students receive on these tests and assignments determine whether they complete or become certified in course material. However, beyond receiving a certification, how do grades impact the learning behavior in students? Do students who receive poor grades actively change their overall activity to improve their grades? To better understand the impact of grades, we observe overall student activity on two MITx MOOCs for certified students and students who continuously participate in MOOC assignments. We use click stream data to compile the overall activity of a student and we use points earned divided by total possible points to calculate the students' grades. We observe that students with the highest levels of activity have some of the highest grades. We also observe that the difference in activity before and after the finalization of a grade (delta-Activity) have greater variation as grade increases. Finally, we observe very little changes in grades (delta-grade) for certified students when visualized against delta-Activity and that continuously participating students have greater grade changes compared to certified students. © 2019 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85078071780&doi=10.1109%2fLWMOOCS47620.2019.8939614&partnerID=40&md5=f03e98fae62fb837fb2f3f5be3da74f2,"Proceedings of 2019 IEEE Learning With MOOCS, LWMOOCS 2019",Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"2019 IEEE Learning With MOOCS, LWMOOCS 2019",,,

Their value can be quantified by the 'doer effect'-A reliable correlation between practice and learning outcomes that is stronger than the correlation between video watching and learning outcomes. In two computational thinking and programming MOOCs, we first confirm the doer effect for all certificate earners in short and long term grade outcomes. This leads to asking: Is the doer effect similar when experienced learners are compared to novices? Is it present, regardless of the topic being taught? We find the doer effect varies in magnitude across learners of different experience level and topics, suggesting that the importance of practice depends on the topic and the learner's background.

The aim of this study was to investigate learners' behaviours and correlate patterns of Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) with performance and achievement during a MOOC in Implant Dentistry. Methods: The clickstream data of learners from the first run of the MOOC Implant dentistry by The University of Hong Kong were modelled and quantified based on Zimmerman's SRL model. The data were quantitatively analysed by means of k-means clustering for evidence of five SRL behavioural indicators of student activity. The clusters identified were then correlated with student engagement and learning performance. Results: A total of 7608 individuals enrolled, 5014 engaged (active learners 65.90%), 1277 of them (25.47%) completed the course and 1232 purchased a certificate. Two major groups of learners emerged: Attentive (n = 1433) who were more likely to follow the prescribed pathway in the MOOC and Auditors (n = 3581) who accessed content selectively. There was significantly higher engagement, achievement and completion rates among Attentive than Auditors. Both groups included subcategories (Browser, Digger, Test-driven, Sampler, Persistent) which might reflect different SRL strategies. Conclusion: A MOOC in a clinical discipline can achieve high enrolment and completion rates as compared to current benchmarks. There appears to be a wide diversity of learning behaviours among learners, with two however dominant patterns. Learners with a linear learning pathway achieved significantly higher grades and completion rates than those who accessed content irregularly and selectively. Such differences however might be influenced by the demographic and professional background of the learner, as well as their motivation to attending the MOOC. Certain learning behaviours, in particular how learners access content in relation to assessments might be closer related to SRL. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Specifically, technical support for goal-oriented and self-regulated learning to date is very limited in this context although both learning strategies are proven to be key factors for students’ achievement in large-scale online learning environments. In this first investigation, a concept for the application and technical integration of personalized learning objectives in a MOOC platform is realized and assessed. It is evaluated with a mixed-method approach. First, the learners’ acceptance is examined with a multivariate A/B test in two courses. Second, a survey was conducted to gather further feedback about the perceived usefulness, next to the acceptance. The results show a positive perception by the learners, which paves the way for future research. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

To better understand how student behavior is influenced by grade feedback, we conduct a study on the changes of certified students’ behavior before and after they have received their grade. We use observational student data from two MITx MOOCs to examine student behavior before and after a grade is released and calculate the difference (the delta-activity). We then analyze the changes in the delta-activity distributions across all graded assignments a we observe that the variation in delta-activity decreases as grade decreases, with students who have the lowest grade exhibiting little or no change in weekly activity. This trend persists throughout each course, in all course offerings, suggesting that a change in grade does not correlate with a change in the behavior of certified MOOC students.

Through web platforms, universities and other institutions offer content and courses where any student can enroll. With this new approach, much knowledge that previously was only accessible to official students paying, in general, expensive fees, is now accessible to any citizen for free. In addition, institutions of higher education usually grant a certificate to students who passed the course. However, this divulgative and massive open approach also creates some distortions. In particular, the management of MOOC courses is a task of extreme complexity, due to the mixture of a large number of very different student profiles, and the combination of nonaligned interests. As a consequence, the dropout rate in these courses is higher than 70% in most courses. In any case, before proposing any solution, it is necessary to analyze and study the current situation in a systematic and scientific way. Therefore, this article describes an experience carried out jointly by professors from the Universidad Politécnica de Madrid (UPM, Spain) and the University of Tras os Montes e Alto Douro (Portugal), based on the creation and teaching of a MOOC course focused on domotics and Arduino technologies, accessible on the MiriadaX platform.

By early 2018 the database contained 136 relevant entries from 46 countries. Most examples (60%) were in a language other than English. More than 50% of entries addressed multiple ES or the link between biodiversity and ES. There was also a positive temporal trend towards inclusion of multiple ecosystem services. The GlobaLDES database represents the first known snapshot of the mainstreaming of the ES concept at a global scale. Our analysis suggests an accelerating adoption of the ES concept into policy.

Industry leaders can benefit from these courses because they foster the professional development of their employees in their industry. Despite these benefits, these online courses continue to register a high dropout rate and a vast number of their learners do not acquire the certificate provided at the completion of the course. This article proposes a predictive modeling tool with several Machine Learning algorithms (for generating Predictive Models) and feature engineering in MOOCs data integrated to contribute research to this specific issue. The proposed tool predicts two situations: which learners are likely to leave the course (dropout) and which learners are expected to pass the course (certificate acquisition). The tool was tested in fifteen deliveries of seven MOOCs. Initial results provide interesting information, for instance, that the accuracy of predicting certificate acquisition is higher than the precision of predicting dropout for all algorithms. © 2018 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85061832448&doi=10.1109%2fIEEM.2018.8607541&partnerID=40&md5=0201e782bee095112b5e261dd2cc257b,IEEE International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management,IEEE Computer Society,"2018 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management, IEEM 2018",,,
Scopus,Conference Paper,"Alecu A.A., Pavaloiu B.I., Dobre-Trifan C.G.",A novel free cloud service for machine learning and beyond,2019,"The concept of eLearning has grown exponentially in recent years. Indeed, what was but a few decades ago exclusively reserved for classroom attendees of university institutions and their closed intranets has today become a publicly accessible source of information, with public and private-owned eLearning MOOC (Massive Open Online Courses) platforms dominating the digital landscape and bringing with them a plethora of services such as video courses, certifications and employee recruitment. Nonetheless, while adding significant public value, such platforms still fail to completely bridge the gap between academia and industry in the hands-on knowledge application sense. This is especially true for domains such as machine learning that are known to require tremendous computational resources if one wishes to transition from simplistic lab exercises to complex state-of-the-art models, which is something a MOOC - or most academic institutions for that matter - simply cannot afford. Private cloud providers have taken up the challenge here and opened their offerings to the research community with programs such as TensorFlow Research Cloud, Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK) on Azure, Apache MXNet on Amazon AWS, to name but a few. Nonetheless, access to such resources remains limited: either the resources themselves are scarce and consequently freely available only to a restricted research community, or they are free for a limited time, or they follow a freemium model. This paper describes a novel distributed publicly-hosted overlay network that provides free collaborative eLearning material and computational resources to its users. Unlike most of its P2P counterparts in existence today that address alternative public needs (i.e. anonymity, file sharing,…), it offers unlimited runtime access to all the computational resources that collectively define its topology. In this respect, an example use case is one wherein a distributed machine learning system can be orchestrated by any user and freely deployed for execution on any number of available nodes within the network, without any limitation other than that of the underlying hardware and network latency performance capabilities themselves. Additionally, source code and accompanying eLearning courses are regularly published to the network and made freely available by users belonging to the academic and subject matter expert practitioner community, implementing solutions ranging from simple classroom exercises to entire production-ready systems. The network is collaborative by design, such that learning material can be collectively worked on and published, training data can be shared and successfully deployed software solutions can be load-balanced and made accessible to the entire community. Moreover, the distributed network follows a decentralized model governed only by a handful of master nodes that, similarly to all its other nodes, are hosted by the users themselves, and in this sense constitutes a novel cloud offering maintained by the general public rather than any given private cloud provider. Finally, we argue that beyond its educational and computational power offerings, the described network likely constitutes the best test platform for any designed software system: indeed, given the volatile nature of the network (wherein user-hosted resources can join or go offline at any moment), we claim that any software system that can “survive” and maintain its levels of SLA (service level agreement) on this network is guaranteed to perform similarly or better on a more traditional pay-per-usage cloud provider infrastructure. © 2019, National Defence University - Carol I Printing House.

MOOCs are online courses that are open to everyone and anyone to join with typically no limits to the number of participants or prerequisite qualifications. In some MOOCs there is an option to pay for a certificate upon completion. This chapter captures the use and future of MOOCs in the biomedical sciences. As the number of MOOCs available in biomedical subject areas grow, so do the number of participants taking these courses, with many of these learners and professionals looking to update their knowledge in the biomedical sciences. There is also a growing use of MOOCs in higher education as a recourse for campus degree programmes, known as hybrid MOOCs, where the MOOC provides the learning and the assessment is undertaken by the educational institution. The growing number of MOOCs available for credit is changing the way some learners are accessing higher education and the development of micro degrees obtained through the completion of a number of MOOCs may potentially change the way higher education is provided in the future. Finally, the potential of artificial intelligence to provide virtual classroom assistants is also a possible game changer, allowing more personalised learning to be delivered at scale. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85076359778&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-24281-7_5&partnerID=40&md5=f2e65361a2ecadd7ba31c53b57a109b7,Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology,Springer,,,,

Massive open online course (MOOC) platforms such as Coursera, edX, and Udemy have made available several thousands of short courses at several difficulty levels in a wide variety of disciplines, ranging from business, computer science to literature, for learners to select from. Learners who are looking to earn credentials for career advancement or personal interest would find MOOCs attractive not only because of the time and place flexibility these courses offer, but also because of the free enrollment or the very small certificate fee upon completion, as well as the emergent recognition these courses are receiving for their high quality learning delivery from leading educational institutions. Learners who enroll in a MOOC would typically need to participate in various learning activities and complete a few assessment tasks to complete the course. However, it has been commonly reported that the completion rates of MOOCs are low. Based on the common notion that when learners are more motivated to learn, they are likely to better engage in learning and have a higher likelihood to complete a MOOC, this study adopted the Motivation and Engagement Scale (MES) by Martin (2007, 2009) to collect responses from university students to examine whether positive motivation resulted in positive engagement; whether negative motivation resulted in negative engagement; and how positive or negative engagement swayed learners’ inclination to complete a MOOC if they were to enroll in one. Findings show that there was a statistically significant positive relationship between positive motivation and positive engagement, between negative motivation and negative engagement, and between positive engagement and inclination to complete a MOOC. However, the relationship between negative engagement and inclination to complete a MOOC was statistically not significant. Findings of this study can be useful to MOOC providers and learners in their effort to develop strategies to increase completion rates of MOOCs. ©ACPIL",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85071172010&doi=10.34190%2fJEL.17.2.05&partnerID=40&md5=7d7820725ad362f8658960da54bebb07,Electronic Journal of e-Learning,Academic Publishing Ltd,,,,

In this article, we discuss a future approach for courses in Higher Education Institutions (HEIs), inspired by the Nordic welfare state model, and MOOC platform technology. Contrary to many earlier MOOC initiatives, where access was free of charge and open to all, we see a commercial freemium trend on MOOC platforms. Now we see a trend towards short, free, ""teaser"" courses that encourage learners to pay for a certificate and to undertake quality assured and accredited micro-master courses hidden behind paywalls. This trend aligns with the principle of paid access to courses on campus in Higher Education in many countries. In this paper, we argue that MOOC platforms should be a vehicle to promote transparency, i.e. open access to high quality, research informed and instructionally designed course content, regardless of the nature of the course. In doing so, universities could contribute to strengthening the quality of content available to all learners on the Internet in the short term (e.g. Facebook Google, and YouTube) and in the long term (democracy, equity and academic thinking). The approach we propose is based on our contribution to a strategic policy document for further education at a larger Nordic university in 2018. © 2019 CEUR-WS.

One example application domain, where this is a requirement, is in relation to Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) when users wish to obtain some kind of certification as evidence that they have successfully competed a course. Such continuous authentication can best be realised using some forms of biometric checking; traditional user credential checking methods, for example username and password checking, only provide for “entry” authentication. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for the continuous authentication of computer users founded on keystroke dynamics (keyboard behaviour patterns); a form of behavioural biometric. The proposed method conceptualises keyboard dynamics in terms of a Multivariate-Keystroke Time Series which in turn can be transformed into the spectral domain. The time series can then be monitored dynamically for typing patterns that are indicative of a claimed user. Two transforms are considered, the Discrete Fourier Transform and the Discrete Wavelet Transform. The proposed method is fully described and evaluated, in the context of impersonation detection, using real keystroke datasets. The reported results indicate that the proposed time series mechanism produced an excellent performance, outperforming the comparator approaches by a significant margin. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85063981777&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-15640-4_3&partnerID=40&md5=213b597dc079a8926c9219cbcf892058,Communications in Computer and Information Science,Springer Verlag,"9th International Joint Conference on Knowledge Discovery, Knowledge Engineering and Knowledge Management, IC3K 2017",,,

A qualitative study using semi-structured interviews was undertaken with participants on the PGCert to investigate learner experiences of both the MOOC and PGCert, and to establish the extent to which the MOOC supported learners’ transitions into the PGCert in terms of their (1) foundation knowledge, (2) study skills, (3) digital literacies, (4) readiness for self-directed learning, and to determine whether additional efforts could have been directed to more effectively support student transitions. Findings revealed that the MOOC informed participants’ decision to undertake the fully online PGCert, and that this was due to the effective learning design and a strong teacher presence throughout. The participants already possessed some background knowledge and a number of essential learning skills (though not uniformly), questioning assumptions around MOOCs as an aid to widening participation in higher education; however, the MOOC helped to enhance and unify these. Not surprisingly, there were some challenges encountered on entering online postgraduate study that the MOOC design could not anticipate or solve; therefore, we recommend that online learners are appropriately supported throughout their studies. This work has implications in terms of how MOOCs may help facilitate student transitions into other fully online, credit-bearing programmes of study. © 2018 E.

Scopus,Article,Lee Y.,Effect of uninterrupted time-on-task on students’ success in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs),2018,"This study investigated the relationship between uninterrupted time-on-task and academic success of students enrolled in a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC). The variables representing uninterrupted time-on-task, such as number and duration of uninterrupted consecutive learning activities, were mined from the log files capturing how 4286 students tried to learn Newtonian mechanics concepts in a MOOC. These variables were used as predictors in the logistic regression model estimating the likelihood of students getting a course certificate at the end of the semester. The analysis results indicate that the predictive power of the logistic regression model, which was assessed by Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC), depends on the value of off-task activity threshold time, and the likelihood of students getting a course certificate increases as students were doing more uninterrupted learning activities over a longer period of time. The findings from this study suggest that a simple count of learning activities, which has been used as a proxy for time-on-task in previous studies, may not accurately describe student learning in the computer-based learning environment because it does not reflect the quality, such as uninterrupted durations, of those learning activities. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85047468800&doi=10.1016%2fj.chb.2018.04.043&partnerID=40&md5=5954b69cc09b41a41639fb795cbbae36,Computers in Human Behavior,Elsevier Ltd,,,,

In recent years, a number of universities and colleges have developed MOOCs. While this space within the educational landscape has garnered interest from many of the top schools worldwide, very few of them have actually provided pathways for students in these MOOCs to earn college credit. Most of the schools that have provided such pathways have focused on Master's level programs, rather than undergraduate programs. One first-of-its-kind initiative is Arizona State University's Global Freshman Academy (GFA) in which versions of all first year classes are being developed for this MOOC environment with options to receive college credit from Arizona State University (ASU). The Introduction to Engineering course described in this paper was developed for a Fall 2017 launch as a part of the ASU GFA initiative. This course is the first Introduction to Engineering course offered with pathways for college credit in this MOOC environment. In an attempt to provide the same quality of education to online students as traditional students, this course integrates best practices such as active project-based learning, multi-disciplinary concepts, contextualizing course concepts within industry practices, ePortfolio documentation of skills, and collaborative peer engagement unlike anything currently available in Introduction to Engineering courses in the MOOC community. In the first offering of this course, 4,014 students were enrolled including 69 students who paid a small fee to be ID-verified in order to potentially receive a certificate for completion of the course; 22 students successfully completed the course. This paper describes the course goals, structure, and design including specific challenges related to designing a course for the MOOC environment. The implementation of the course will also be discussed, including preliminary data on the effectiveness obtained from an end-of-course survey administered to students enrolled in the first offering of the course.

Out of the points that have been scored for weekly and final exams a certificate can be issued. Our approach extends the possibility to receive points for the final score with practical programming exercises on real hardware. It allows the student to do embedded programming by communicating over GPIO pins to control LEDs and measure sensor values. Additionally, they can visualize values on an embedded display using web technologies, which are an essential part of embedded and smart home devices to communicate with common APIs. Students have the opportunity to solve all tasks within the online remote lab and at home on the same kind of hardware.

While massive open enrolment and the advances of learning technology are creating exciting potentials for lifelong learning in formal and informal ways, the implementation of efficient and effective assessment is still problematic. To ensure that genuine learning occurs, both assessments for learning (formative assessments), which evaluate students’ current progress, and assessments of learning (summative assessments), which record students’ cumulative progress, are needed. Providers’ more recent shift towards the granting of certificates and digital badges for course accomplishments also indicates the need for proper, secure and accurate assessment results to ensure accountability. This article examines possible assessment approaches that fit open online education from formative and summative assessment perspectives. The authors discuss the importance of, and challenges to, implementing assessments of MOOC learners’ progress for both purposes. Various formative and summative assessment approaches are then identified. The authors examine and analyse their respective advantages and disadvantages.

However, since only a small percentage of enrollees complete MOOCs, it is important to understand participants’ preliminary expectations and motivations. This is particularly important for science and engineering MOOCs because they require professional knowledge, analytical skills, and the ability to handle abstract models of physical phenomena. Hence, the goal of this study was to examine the motivating factors of learners who successfully completed a MOOC in nanotechnology and nanosensors, while comparing between university-affiliated students (N = 114) and general participants (N = 194). Analysis of data, collected via an online survey, forum posts, and email messages, identified three motivational themes: career, personal, and educational. The findings indicated that participants from both groups were motivated by general interest, personal growth, and enrichment. However, while the university-affiliated students were oriented toward improving knowledge and receiving a certificate, the general participants were oriented toward research and professional advancement.

However, few studies have focused on combining student logs with forum data. In this work, we use data from two different offerings of the same MOOC. We conduct a survival analysis to identify likely dropouts. We then examine two classes of features, social and behavioral, and apply a combination of modeling and feature-selection methods to identify the most relevant features to predict both dropout and certification. We examine the utility of three different model types and we consider the impact of different definitions of dropout on the predictors. Finally we assess the reliability of the models over time by evaluating whether or not models from week 1 can predict dropout in week 2, and so on.

Study behavior is correlated with whether or not the student can get a certificate or drop out from a course. It is of predominant importance to identify the particular behavioral patterns and establish an accurate predictive model for the learning results, so that tutors can give well-focused assistance and guidance on specific students. However, the behavioral records of individuals are usually very sparse; behavioral records between individuals are inconsistent in time and skewed in contents. These remain big challenges for the state-of-the-art methods. In this paper, we engage the concept of subgroup as a trade-off to overcome the sparsity of individual behavioral records and inconsistency between individuals. We employ the framework of Exceptional Model Mining (EMM) to discover exceptional student behavior. Various model classes of EMM are applied on dropout rate analysis, correlation analysis between length of learning behavior sequence and course grades, and passing state prediction analysis.

Motivation for participating in such courses can be very different. Results of previous studies indicate that motivation is associated with persistence in university programs and in online environments. Therefore, is important to understand for which purpose(s) learners use MOOCs and to compare determinants, including motivation, of completion and non-completion. Still, there is shortage of evidence about the motives that are associated with MOOC completion in the light of different motivational theories. The aim of this paper is to compare enrolment motivations of completers and non-completers in programming MOOC. Studying motivation in MOOC, we rely on the expectancy-value theory, because task value as a main component of this theory is especially relevant for research aiming to explain people’s voluntary engagement in learning and for understanding what causes a person to initially choose to take part in a MOOC we need to understand value and worth of this MOOC for the participant. Two research questions were posed: (1) What are the main motivating factors for completers and non-completers of a programming MOOC? (2) What are the differences in motivation factors between completers and non-completers? Validated FIEM (Factors Influencing Enrolment in MOOCs) scale was used collecting data from 1,302 participants. The data on completion or non-completion of the MOOC was taken from the learning environment. Evaluation of the participants has been analyzed using seven factors discovered in previous research. Using multivariate analyses of variance with the Bonferroni adjustment statistically significant differences were found in four factors: ‘interest and expectancies for course’, ‘personal suitability of distance learning’, ‘usefulness related to certification’, and ‘social influence’. All these factors were rated higher by completers than by non-completers. Recommendation could be made for taking account these motivational factors to decrease dropout in MOOCs. © The Authors, 2018.

Academic institutions need high-quality preparatory curricula and mentorship to prepare learners for potential challenges in ethics, cultural sensitivity, and personal safety; however, availability and quality of these are variable. Objective: The objective of this study is to create and evaluate an open-access, interactive massive open online course (MOOC) that prepares learners to safely and effectively participate in STEGH, permits flexible and asynchronous learning, is free of charge, and provides a certificate upon successful completion. Methods: Global health experts from 8 countries, 42 institutions, and 7 specialties collaborated to create The Practitioner’s Guide to Global Health (PGGH): the first course of this kind on the edX platform. Demographic data, pre- and posttests, and course evaluations were collected and analyzed. Results: Within its first year, PGGH enrolled 5935 learners from 163 countries. In a limited sample of 109 learners, mean posttest scores were significantly improved (p < 0.01). In the course’s second year, 213 sampled learners had significant improvement (p < 0.001). Conclusion: We created and evaluated the first interactive, asynchronous, free-of-charge global health preparation MOOC.

Scopus,Article,"Bonafini F.C., Chae C., Park E., Jablokow K.W.",How much does student engagement with videos and forums in a MOOC affect their achievement?,2017,"Engagement in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) is based on students who self-organize their participation according to their own goals and interests. Visual materials such as videos and discussion forums are basic ways of engaging students in MOOCs. Student achievement in MOOCs is typically measured using assessments distributed throughout the course. Although there is research on the basic forms of student’s engagement and assessment in MOOCs, little is known about their effect on students’ achievement in the form of students completing a MOOC. Using binomial logistic regression models, this paper addresses this gap in the literature by presenting the degree to which student engagement with videos and forum posts can predict students’ probability of achievement in a MOOC. It also explores the extent to which participation behaviors and their intention to receive the course certification can be used to predict achievement in MOOCs. Using qualitative content analysis, this paper discusses the quality of the forum posts exchanged by participants in this MOOC. The findings from quantitative analysis support MOOC’s pedagogical assumptions, showing that students’ engagement in forums and with videos increases the probability of course achievement. It also shows that intention to certify plays a moderator effect on the number of videos watched, enhancing achievement in MOOCs. The findings from qualitative analysis reveal that most students’ posts in forums display more information acquisition than critical thinking. Implications for practice suggest MOOC designers and MOOC instructors foster engagement in forums by implementing discussion prompts that foster interactions about deep meaning of concepts or application of concepts covered in the MOOC. In regard to videos, implications for practice suggest the creation of interactive videos that promote students’ engagement and control such as inserting guiding questions and segmenting the video content. Future research comprising multiple MOOC cohorts is suggested to validate the empirical model presented in this study. © 2017, The Online Learning Consortium.

Methods: A 5-week MOOC on behavioral medicine was hosted on the edX platform. The authors developed two branched virtual patients consisting of video recordings of a live standardized patient, with multiple clinical decision points and narration unfolding depending on learners' choices. Students interacted with the virtual patients to treat stress and sleep problems. Answers to the exit survey and participant comments from the discussion forum were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. Results: In total, 19,236 participants enrolled in the MOOC, out of which 740 received the final certificate. The virtual patients were completed by 2317 and 1640 participants respectively. Among survey respondents (n = 442), 83.1% agreed that the virtual patient exercise was helpful. The qualitative analysis resulted in themes covering what it was like to work with the virtual patient, with subthemes on learner-centered education, emotions/eustress, game comparisons, what the participants learned, what surprised them, how confident participants felt about applying interventions in practice, suggestions for improvement, and previous experiences of virtual patients. Conclusions: Students were enthusiastic about interacting with the virtual patients as a means to apply new knowledge about behavioral medicine interventions. The most common suggestion was to incorporate more interactive cases with various levels of complexity.

However, in contrast to traditional classroom settings, many aspects of learners' behaviour in MOOCs are not well researched. In this work, we focus on modelling learner behaviour in the context of continuous assessments with completion certificates, the most common assessment setup in MOOCs today. Here, learners can obtain a completion certificate once they obtain a required minimal score (typically somewhere between 50 - 70%) in tests distributed throughout the duration of a MOOC. In this se.ing, the course material or tests provided a.er ""passing"" do not contribute to earning the certi€cate (which is ungraded), thus potentially affecting learners' behaviour. Therefore, we explore how ""passing"" impacts MOOC learners: do learners alter their behaviour after this point? And if so how?

It is termed CAMEO – Copying Answers using Multiple Existence Online. A person using CAMEO sets up one or more harvesting accounts for collecting correct answers; these are then submitted in the user's master account for credit. The study has three main goals: Determining the prevalence of CAMEO, studying its detailed characteristics, and inferring the motivation(s) for using it. For the physics course that we studied, about 10% of the certificate earners used this method to obtain more than 1% of their correct answers, and more than 3% of the certificate earners used it to obtain the majority (>50%) of their correct answers. We discuss two of the likely consequences of CAMEO: jeopardizing the value of MOOC certificates as academic credentials, and generating misleading conclusions in educational research. Based on our study, we suggest methods for reducing CAMEO. Although this study was conducted on a MOOC, CAMEO can be used in any learning environment that enables students to have multiple accounts. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85013224880&doi=10.1016%2fj.compedu.2017.01.015&partnerID=40&md5=68eb8e868c8044fbbf726d358198306b,Computers and Education,Elsevier Ltd,,,,

This intention-action gap is found in many domains of human experience, and research in similar goal pursuit domains suggests that plan-making is a cheap and effective nudge to encourage follow-through. In a natural field experiment in three HarvardX courses, some students received open-ended planning prompts at the beginning of a course. These prompts increased course completion by 29%, and payment for certificates by 40%. This effect was largest for students enrolled in traditional schools. Furthermore, the contents of students' plans could predict which students were least likely to succeed - in particular, students whose plans focused on specific times were unlikely to complete the course. Our results suggest that planning prompts can help learners adopted productive frames of mind at the outset of a learning goal that encourage and forecast student success. © 2017 ACM.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85016516377&doi=10.1145%2f3027385.3027416&partnerID=40&md5=319884ab2ae4bf5d537b4d2d70907d55,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,Association for Computing Machinery,"7th International Conference on Learning Analytics and Knowledge, LAK 2017",,,

Although the use of MOOCs in Malaysian Universities are evident from the Malaysian OpenLeanring MOOCs portal, still the millions of learners who have already participated in MOOCS, do not move to the stage of obtaining a completion certificate (Kolowick, 2013). As such, in the context of Malaysia, there seems to be a serious concern for all those who wish to implement MOOCs in their pedagogical system. This research employed the bootstrapping resampling approach of Shrout and Bolger (2002) to assess the mediating effects of Intention to Enroll in MOOCs (IE). The mediation analysis was used to determine the mediation effects of Intention to Enroll in MOOCs (IE) on relationships between Facilitating Conditions (FC) and Habit (HB) as independent variables and MOOCs Actual Usage (AU) as dependent variable.

MOOCs demonstrate universities’ efforts in offering high-quality digital learning materials to everyone in the world, which should be encouraged. Nevertheless, as a MOOC platform must ensure its financial sustainability, it is questionable whether a platform’s profit-seeking pricing strategy will hurt the diversity of courses, such as eliminating courses with low certificate purchasing rates. To address this question, we adopt a game-theoretic framework to model the interaction and strategic choices of a MOOC platform, learners, and universities. Based on the certificate prices and revenue sharing ratios chosen by the platform for courses with various certificate purchasing rates, universities consider the competition intensity and decide their course quality levels, to attract learners. We conclude that all types of course will exists in equilibrium throughout the lifecycle of a MOOC platform, regardless of the technology maturity and competition intensity. We also find that course qualities may decrease when MOOCs become more accessible to learners.

Recently, a large-scale study on the log traces from more than one hundred MOOCs created by Harvard and MIT has identified a specific cheating strategy viable in MOOCs: Copying Answers using Multiple Existences Online (CAMEO). In essence, learners create several accounts on a MOOC platform, request assessment solutions via some of the accounts, and then submit these “harvested” solutions in their main account to receive credit.

However, there are still many details that remain unknown about the strategies that students follow while studying online. In this study, we focus on the direction of detecting 'invisible' collaboration ties between students in online learning environments. Specifically, the paper presents a method developed to detect student ties based on temporal proximity of their assignment submissions. The paper reports on findings of a study that made use of the proposed method to investigate the presence of close submitters in two different massive open online courses. The results show that most of the students (i.e., student user accounts) were grouped as couples, though some bigger communities were also detected. The study also compared the population detected by the algorithm with the rest of user accounts and found that close submitters needed a statistically significant lower amount of activity with the platform to achieve a certificate of completion in a MOOC. These results confirm that the detected close submitters were performing some collaboration or even engaged in unethical behaviors, which facilitates their way into a certificate. However, more work is required in the future to specify various strategies adopted by close submitters and possible associations between the user accounts. © 2017 International World Wide Web Conference Committee (IW3C2), published under Creative Commons CC BY 4.0 License.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85053187801&doi=10.1145%2f3041021.3054161&partnerID=40&md5=dd075ddd25e41c29f61813d750484419,"26th International World Wide Web Conference 2017, WWW 2017 Companion",International World Wide Web Conferences Steering Committee,"26th International World Wide Web Conference, WWW 2017 Companion",,,

The chapter has three themes: the political economy of MOOCs, their pedagogy, and their relationship to lifelong learning and adult education. Speight argues that early hopes for MOOCs to widen access to adult and higher education are replaced by the positioning of MOOCs as routes into fee-paying, post-experience, and certificated learning. Currently available evidence suggests that it is postgraduate learners who possess the motivation and skills to benefit most from MOOCs. There are views, however, that MOOCs support teaching enhancement and innovation more generally as universities enable greater use of digital learning. © The Author(s) 2018.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85042263906&doi=10.1057%2f978-1-137-55783-4_48&partnerID=40&md5=8ed38e3ada8b4acac4da33612700beaf,The Palgrave International Handbook on Adult and Lifelong Education and Learning,Palgrave Macmillan,,,,

This study aims to determine how often the students benefit from their social media accounts for self-development and also to determine how the use of MOOCs program via social media cause a positive effect for the future studies. The 248 students who participated in this study have expressed that they had followed their accounts regarding to their fields and also had obtained information from these pages. The participants said that, they had created many solutions for too much difficulties they face in real life and visual, written materials and videos loaded on social media. They have also mentioned that, they preferred the social media rather than obtaining information from pages related to MOOCs. The students who want to attend to any certificate program on social media said that; their social media accounts that they follow daily on either web or mobile media is an information obtaining and transferring tool. They have pointed out that, the duration and quality of videos they reach on social media was important and when they are high quality they obtain more permanent information. The questionnaire of the study was developed by the researcher. The research is quantitative and the data analysis was done by SPSS program.

Characterizing the different types of participation in MOOCs is fundamental in order to be able to better evaluate the phenomenon and to support MOOCs developers and instructors in devising courses which are adapted for different learners' needs. Thus, the purpose of this study was to characterize the different types of participant behavior in a MOOC. Using a data mining methodology, 21,889 participants of a MOOC were classified into clusters, based on their activity in the main learning resources of the course: video lectures, discussion forums, and assessments. Thereafter, the participants in each cluster were characterized in regard to demographics, course participation, and course achievement characteristics. Seven types of participant behavior were identified: Tasters (64.8%), Downloaders (8.5%), Disengagers (11.5%), Offline Engagers (3.6%), Online Engagers (7.4%), Moderately Social Engagers (3.7%), and Social Engagers (0.6%). A significant number of 1,020 participants were found to be engaged in the course, but did not achieve a certificate. The types are discussed according to the established research questions. The results provide further evidence regarding the utilization of the flexibility, which is offered in MOOCs, by the participants according to their needs.

This allows for the possibility of making predictions about future learning outcomes of students based on these interactions. The prediction of certificate accomplishment can enable the early detection of students at risk, in order to perform interventions before it is too late. This study applies different machine learning techniques to predict which students are going to get a certificate during different timeframes. The purpose is to be able to analyze how the quality metrics change when the models have more data available. From the four machine learning techniques applied finally we choose a boosted trees model which provides stability in the prediction over the weeks with good quality metrics.

As a form of largely free and self-paced education, MOOCs are less formal than creditbearing university courses. It is often the case that MOOCs do not count toward a formal university qualification, and that majority learners enter MOOCs for various purposes other than specifically gaining a certificate. As a result, assessment and critical thinking, valued by universities as important learning outcomes are thought to be less relevant to MOOCs learners or designers. In the last couple of years, however, a few universities have started to design credit-bearing MOOCs as part of university programs. The aim is to encourage quality learning and outcomes that satisfy formal university assessment criteria. MOOCs designed to target particular groups of professionals for career advancement are also emerging. Both trends require a rethink of the relevance of assessment and critical thinking in MOOCs. This paper provides a case study of a MOOC targeted at health professionals, which demonstrates how self- and peer-assessment are designed to encourage critical thinking, and includes a discussion on future directions and constraints of this work-in-progress. The paper proposes that critical thinking is relevant for learning in MOOCs and that carefully designed assessment tasks are essential for developing MOOCs’ learners’ critical thinking. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85019709316&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-319-59044-8_33&partnerID=40&md5=0cf71edce5f3c7d61d0d78bbb0b13b80,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),Springer Verlag,"5th European MOOCs Stakeholders Summit, EMOOCs 2017",,,

Despite various features and benefits offered by MOOCs, however, unlike traditional classroom-style education, students enrolled in MOOCs often show a wide variety of motivations, and only quite a small percentage of them participate in the final examinations. To figure out the underlying reasons, in this paper, we make two key contributions. First, we find that being an examinee for a learner is almost a necessary condition of earning a certificate and hence investigation of the examinee rate prediction is of great importance. Second, after conducting extensive investigation of participants’ operation behaviours, we carefully select a set of features that are closely reflect participants’ learning behaviours. We apply existing commonly used classifiers over three online courses, generously provided by China University MOOC platform, to evaluate the effectiveness of the used features. Based on our experiments, we find there does not exist a single classifier that is able to dominate others in all cases, and in many cases, SVN performs the best. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85016403328&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-319-55705-2_27&partnerID=40&md5=e1a32fe104a84df23ed82bd6ddfb21e9,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),Springer Verlag,"International Workshops on Database Systems for Advanced Applications, DASFAA 2017, 4th International Workshop on Big Data Management and Service, BDMS 2017, 2nd Workshop on Big Data Quality Management, BDQM 2017, 4th International Workshop on Semantic Computing and Personalization, SeCoP 2017, 1st International Workshop on Data Management and Mining on MOOCs, DMMOOC 2017",,,

More universities are willing to offer their top notch professor’s courses as MOOC. However, when utilizing the knowledge from MOOCs, learners need to go through a number of hurdles—getting course completion certification (MS Global Learning Consortum: An example of LIP accessibility information, IMS Global Learning Consortium Inc., 2001, [10]) from various providers, get recognition of the knowledge level of a MOOC in the related domain, and make it searchable for various purposes. In this paper, we propose a MOOC course certifying agency framework, which merges learners’ profiles from various MOOC providers so consolidated profiles are available in one place. Standards such as IMS LIP and Dublin Core (Feigenbaum and Prud’Hommeaux in SPARQL by example: a tutorial, Cambridge Semantics, 2011, [5]) are adopted and expanded to describe relate MOOC course profiles, learner profiles, learning goals, and related skill sets. It enables matching of qualified learner profiles for a job position and/or to identify a set of related MOOC course profiles for some learning goal. The potential employers look for a matching skill set from converged learner profiles through the agency. Each skill for the position goes through a mapping procedure with a corresponding MOOC course profile. After mapping skills to corresponding MOOCs, the framework searches for the converged profiles. The result is the list of learners who match or almost match a given job description. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85015729029&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-319-51472-7_13&partnerID=40&md5=9ed407cdbf5a9096f0a981f544ecaca8,Studies in Computational Intelligence,Springer Verlag,"4th International Conference on Applied Computing and Information Technology, ACIT 2016",,,

This retention rate is above the industry standard of 10%; however, the value of retention rate as a metric to judge MOOC success is questionable. Instead, we focus on demographics, with Coursera data estimating that 41% of learners came from Europe, 35% from North America, 11% from Asia, 6% from Oceania, 5% from South America, and 2% from Africa. Most learners had completed an undergraduate degree. Despite this wide range of backgrounds, 57.2% of post-course respondents (n = 2,399) strongly agreed that the information presented was at the right level and 64.9% strongly agreed that the course was interesting. After completion, more students (w2[4] = 132.40, p < .001) understood that animal welfare was based on the results of scientific study, and significantly fewer students (w2[4] = 361.32, p < .001) felt health was the most important part of animal welfare. Overall, learners agreed the course was enjoyable and informative, and 97.9% felt the course was a valuable use of their time.

The strategy, Copying Answers using Multiple Existences Online (CAMEO), involves a user who gathers solutions to assessment questions using a ""harvester"" account and then submits correct answers using a separate ""master"" account. We use a small-scale experiment to verify CAMEO and estimate a ""lower bound"" for its prevalence among 1.9 million course participants in 115 MOOCs from two universities. Using conservative thresholds, we estimate CAMEO prevalence at 1237 certificates, accounting for 1.3% of the certificates in the 69 MOOCs with CAMEO users. Among earners of 20 or more certificates, 25% have used the CAMEO strategy. CAMEO users are more likely to be young, male, and international than other MOOC certificate earners. We identify preventive strategies that can decrease CAMEO rates and show evidence of their effectiveness in science courses. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We deployed this MOOC three times with a total enrollment of over 100,000 students. If MOOCs are truly going to transform engineering education, then they must be able to deliver classes with laboratory components. Our offering goes a long way in unraveling the perceived complexities in delivering a laboratory experience to thousands of students from around the globe. We believe the techniques developed in this class will significantly transform the MOOC environment. Effective education requires students to learn by doing. In the traditional academic setting this active learning is achieved through a lab component. Translating this to the online environment is a non-trivial task that required several important factors to come together. First, we have significant support from industrial partners ARM Inc. [1] and Texas Instruments [2]. Second, the massive growth of embedded microcontrollers has made the availability of lost-cost development platforms feasible. Third, we have assembled a team with the passion, patience, and experience of delivering quality lab experiences to large classes. Fourth, online tools now exist that allow students to interact and support each other. We used edX for the delivery of videos, interactive animations, text, and quizzes [3]. We used Piazza [4] for discussion boards and Zyante[5] for a programming reference. We partnered with element-14[6], Digi-Key[7], and Mouser[8] to make the lab kit available and low-cost. Even though there was a $40-$70 cost to purchase the lab kit, the course completion numbers were slightly better than a typical MOOC. 7.3% of the students completed enough of the class to receive a certificate. Students completing end of the course surveys report a 95% overall satisfaction. Demographics show a world-wide reach with India, US, and Egypt being the countries with the most students.

We show how certain course design aspects affect student behaviour: (a) frequent quizzes correlated with students reading a large fraction of the e-text, and (b) When homework sets are arranged by increasing (instructor-estimated) difficulty, we found strong correlations between difficulty and time to solution, but weak correlations with percent correct. Modifications to the second offering of the course resulted in higher retention. These modifications included targeting physics teachers and posting materials well in advance. We define retention as certificates earned relative to participants who make a significant effort on the second assignment. Retention measured this way varied between 44% and 72%, being highest in the course aimed at teachers. We show that there is significant learning among MOOC participants.

Using dataset from xuetangX, one of the largest MOOCs from China, we analyze key factors that influence students' engagement in MOOCs and study to what extent we could infer a student's learning effectiveness. We observe significant behavioral heterogeneity in students' course selection as well as their learning patterns. For example, students who exert higher effort and ask more questions are not necessarily more likely to get certificates. Additionally, the probability that a student obtains the course certificate increases dramatically (3_ higher) when she has one or more ""certificate friends"". Moreover, we develop a unified model to predict students' learning effectiveness, by incorporating user demographics, forum activities, and learning behavior. We demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms (+2.03-9.03% by F1-score) several alternative methods in predicting students' performance on assignments and course certificates.

Unlike traditional courses, MOOCs require additional skills, provided by videographers, instructional designers, IT specialists and platform specialists. Over the past few years several Universities facilitated partnership with MOOCs providers and are building MOOC courses, to serve as e-learning versions of their courses. Despite all the advantages offered by the MOOC courses, the current statistics show that only a very limited number of registered learners are completing the course. And the vast majority are stopping learning at an early stage. The main reason can be found in the lack of motivation of the students to pass the exams to become a certificate, because universities do not accept the certificates for credits. The aim of this paper is to study the readiness of students to take MOOC courses on one hand and the acceptance of MOOC courses in Universities. A study is conducted on two Universities, Hasselt University, Belgium and Princess Sumaya University for Technology, Jordan. The results of the study are promising, as they suggest that such virtual study programs are accepted in both Universities.

Aim: This study was undertaken to evaluate the strength of and the opportunities for implementing evidence-based nursing practice across a diverse 9-hospital system located in the mid-Atlantic region. Methods: A cross-sectional survey of 6,800 registered nurses (RNs), with a 24% response rate, was conducted to learn about their attitudes, beliefs, and perceptions toward organizational readiness and implementation of EBP. Results: Although respondents' beliefs about EBP were positive, they reported their ability to implement EBP as extremely low. More than one third (36%) of the respondents worked at two of the system's Magnet designated hospitals. Magnet RNs reported more resources and held more positive beliefs about their hospital's organizational readiness for EBP. Nurses who possess advanced nursing degrees, certification, and who serve in leadership roles were favorable toward EBP. Younger RNs with fewer years in practice were more likely to have positive beliefs toward EBP and embedding it into the organizational culture. Linking Evidence to Practice: Findings mirror previous research where nurses internationally favor EBP yet struggle with similar barriers for implementation. Strategies to link this evidence to action can be taken at local and global levels. Locally, transformational nurse leaders within each hospital can share the vision for implementing EBP and embrace Magnet principles. At the system level, transformational nurse leaders can collectively allocate resources to create a system-wide online EBP education plan with EBP competencies and tool kit to increase RN exposure to EBP and standardize practice. Globally, promoting free and accessible EBP massive open online courses (MOOC) and sharing best practices online and at international forums such as Magnet conferences will help to lead, educate, and mentor nurses with strategies to systematically increase EBP uptake. © 2016 Sigma Theta Tau International.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84958169934&doi=10.1111%2fwvn.12149&partnerID=40&md5=97d09a93b9f414efcefcfb1003aee1e1,Worldviews on Evidence-Based Nursing,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,,,,

There were a small number of students at the University of Manitoba who paid tuition and several thousand others who simply participated in the online course environment at no cost. Given the subject (connectivism) of that early MOOC and the fact that those not paying were there as part of an extended community gathered around the subject of the course, it is reasonable to conclude that the ‘C’ in MOOC stood for ‘course’ for registered participants and ‘community’ for those not registered. Since 2008, MOOCs have appeared in many places and have taken many forms. This chapter examines the growth of MOOCs and the roles that they can play in the context of learning and instruction. The argument herein is that it is a mistake to consider current MOOCs to be a new form of a distance learning course.

MOOCs are a new way to design and deliver online learning. Learners become part of an on-line community where they can participate as reviewers, collaborate with each other and are engaged in watching videos and other multimedia resources. However, MOOCs are also generating a huge debate around three different aspects: the learning process including evaluation and certification criteria, the lack of skills among instructors to design and plan MOOCs and the technicaland security issues of MOOC platforms. More specifically, institutions are currently making a great effort to become part of main facilitators' platforms. They are creating a good number of methodologies, guidelines and best practices to equip instructors with the necessary skills to produce high-quality learning resources that can encourage learners' participation and decrease the dropout rate. On the other hand, engineering education is one of the main a reas of interest in MOOC courses. In the software and computer engineering area it is possible to find a huge number of MOOC sinparticular topics ranging from an introductory to a master level. How ever, just a few courses address a holistic view of a domain such as software engineering due to the intrinsic difficulty of summarizingin a few weeks the main concepts of anengineering discipline. That is why, in this paper, authors introduce an Agile MOOC Development Lifecycle (AMDL) to address the challenge of designing a MOOC from scratch.

However, it was not until 2008 that Dave Cormier actually explicitly used the term MOOC for a Massive Open Online Course (Daniel, 2012; Downes, 2012a; Watters, 2012). Downes(2012b) subsequently argued that MOOCs enable large numbers of people to combine the advantages of open content and open learning for learning, training and personal development. This educational model attempts to promote learning for a large number of people with a shared interest, by removing initial limits of access and attendance, and in some cases, offer credits and/or certificates at very lowcost at the end of the course. It is not surprising, therefore, that despite the conflict of interests with theobjectives of formal educational institutions and the many criticisms raised in the literature (Jackson,2013), MOOCs are having a significant impact upon the online educational community, with hundreds of thousands of people undertaking these courses. They have grabbed the public spotlight and been hailed as an ""educational phenomenon"" (Pappano, 2012). 2012 was called ""the Year of the MOOC"" by the New York Times because, arguably, ""the time was right"" for them to appear.

Valuing aggregation and pricing disaggregation in higher education markets,2015,"Massive open online courses (MOOCs) have received considerable publicity over the last few years. Since they offer costless learning experiences, many have seen them as a way of reducing the costs of higher education. A commonly suggested approach is that learners should be able to take a range of MOOCsand use their certificates of completion to assemble a portfolio that reflects their learning accomplishments, with separate educational market-providers offering services such as advisement, assessment, and accreditation of the portfolio content. It is speculated that this fracturing, or disaggregation, of the current higher educating system would allow learners greater choice and reduce the costs of obtaining accredited degrees. This chapter explores the opportunities and challenges presented by MOOCs and the economic and educational implications of a proposed disaggregation of the higher education system. The analysis suggests that disaggregation would not necessarily reduced costs, but that it would inevitably destroy much of the unpaid-for-value that resides for graduates in the current aggregated system of higher education. ©2015, IGI Global.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84954578785&doi=10.4018%2f978-1-4666-8279-5.ch002&partnerID=40&md5=f7f5c9b56baf3d9b31191a7b163494ca,Furthering Higher Education Possibilities through Massive Open Online Courses,IGI Global,,,,

Despite the disruptive changes driven by open publishing in scholarly communication, it is challenging to develop widely accepted methods for quality assessment and certification. Similar challenges exist in open education platforms like the massive open online course (MOOC). This work reviews four types of innovations in open publishing in terms of quality control, namely ""light touch"" peer review, post-publication assessment, social peer review, and open peer review. Synthesising the principles and strategies of these innovations, it discusses how they might be inspiring for developing solutions and models for MOOC assessment and credentialing.

Scopus,Article,"Arrufat M.J.G., Sánchez V.G., Santiuste E.G.",Trends in assessment in massive open online courses [Tendencias en la evaluación del aprendizaje en cursos en línea masivos y abiertos],2015,"Assessment is a central characteristic in the design of massive open online courses (MOOCs) (Sandeen, 2013). Although this phenomenon is new, the literature on e-assessment suggests a direction based on a knowledge base derived from research into the support needs of the participants’ learning. Together with assessment, participant satisfaction with MOOCs takes on a special role when we consider the interest of the courses and their high drop-out rate. We have two objectives in this paper; on one hand, we analyze the assessment processes in 87 MOOCs developed on different international platforms (Coursera, Udacity, MiríadaX, EdX, and RedunX) at Spanish universities (AbiertaUGR, UPVX, UniMOOC, UnedComa, and Ehusfera) and others; while on the other hand, we reflect on these processes assisted by the study of the MOOCs developed at the University of Granada (Spain). We describe the results classified according to: what is assessed, who performs the assessment, time at which assessment occurs, instruments employed, type of assessment, and type of the certification (participation/accreditation). We study the satisfaction of 513 participants in courses of the first edition offered by AbiertaUGR in 2013. Participant satisfaction is related to interactivity, and the learning perceived corresponds to a formative assessment or assessment for learning. Suggestions for improvement are given for the pedagogical design of the assessment in future MOOCs. © 2015, Universidad Nacional de Educacion a Distancia.

Despite these factors, the flexible learning offered by a MOOC has the potential to provide an accessible educational environment for a broad spectrum of participants. In this regard, the Wicking Dementia Research and Education Centre has developed a MOOC on dementia that is evidence-based and intended to address this emerging major global public health issue by providing educational resources to a broad range of caregivers, people with dementia, and health care professionals. Methods: The Understanding Dementia MOOC was designed specifically to appeal to, and support, adult learners with a limited educational background. The nine-week course was presented in three units. Participants passed a quiz at the end of each unit to continue through the course. A series of discussion boards facilitated peer-to-peer interactions. A separate ""Ask an Expert"" discussion board also was established for each unit where participants posted questions and faculty with expertise in the area responded. Results: Almost 10,000 people from 65 countries registered; 4,409 registrants engaged in the discussion boards, and 3,624 (38%) completed the course. Participants' level of education ranged from postgraduate study to a primary (elementary) school education. Participants without a university education (vocational certificate and below) were as likely as those with a university education to complete the course (_2=2.35, df=6, p=0.88) and to engage in the online discussions (F[6, 3799]=0.85, p=0.54). Further, participants who completed the MOOC engaged in significantly more discussion board posts than participants who did not complete the course (t=39.60, df=4407, p &lt;0.001). Conclusions: The high completion rate and level of engagement of participants across a broad spectrum of levels of education suggest that MOOCs can be successfully developed and delivered to students from diverse educational backgrounds. The high participation rate also highlights the combination of MOOC design as well as the scale of unmet need for quality dementia education. © 2015 Goldberg et al.; licensee BioMed Central.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84926341628&doi=10.1186%2fs12909-015-0344-z&partnerID=40&md5=47f30b3a9af951447852eab10d5256e1,BMC Medical Education,BioMed Central Ltd.,,,,

In 2013, HarvardX offered two ""runs"" of the HeroesX course: In the first, content was released weekly over four months; in the second, all content was released at once. We develop three operationalizations of ""ontrackness"" to measure how students participated in sync with the recommended syllabus. Ontrackness in both versions was low, though in the second, mean ontrackness was approximately one-half of levels in the first HeroesX. We find few differences in persistence, participation, and completion between the two runs. Controlling for a students' number of active weeks, we estimate modest positive effects of ontrackness on certification. The revealed preferences of students for flexibility and the minimal benefits of ontrackness suggest that releasing content all at once may be a viable strategy for MOOC designers.

In the autumn of 2013, Peking University released its first six courses on the Coursera platform. Through mining and analyzing the massive data of learning behavior of over 80000 participants from the courses, this paper endeavors to manifest more than one side of learning activity in MOOC. Meanwhile, according to the characteristic of learning behavior in Chinese MOOC, learners are classified into several groups and then the relationship between their learning behavior and performance is thoroughly studied. Based on the above work, we find out that learners' performance, regarding whether he/she could get certificated eventually, can be predicted by looking into several features of their learning behavior. Experiment results indicate that these features can be trained to effectively estimate whether a learner is probably to complete the course successfully. Besides, this method has the potential to partially evaluate the quality of both teaching and learning in practice. ©, 2015, Jisuanji Yanjiu yu Fazhan/Computer Research and Development.

In this paper, we propose a Massive Open Online Proctoring (MOOP) framework, which combines both automatic and collab-orative approaches to detect cheating behaviors in on-line tests. The MOOP framework consists of three ma-jor components: Automatic Cheating Detector (ACD), Peer Cheating Detector (PCD), and Final Review Com-mittee (FRC). ACD uses webcam video or other sensors to monitor students and automatically ag suspected cheating behavior. Ambiguous cases are then sent to the PCD, where students peer-review agged webcam video to confirm suspicious cheating behaviors. Finally, the list of suspicious cheating behaviors is sent to the FRC to make the final punishing decision. Our experiment show that ACD and PCD can detect usage of a cheat sheet with good accuracy and can reduce the overall hu-man resources required to monitor MOOCs for cheating. © 2015 ACM.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84968919521&doi=10.1145%2f2675133.2675245&partnerID=40&md5=810a5d41690ae20b8b9d7c167e114b47,CSCW 2015 - Proceedings of the 2015 ACM International Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","18th ACM International Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing, CSCW 2015",,,

Exploring recognition of non-formal learning",2015,"Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) are disrupting traditional, higher education and redefining how learning takes place online. These open courses typically offer some form of recognition, such as a certificate of completion and/or digital badge, to recognize, validate, and in some cases even accredit learning. A general problem with MOOCs is the uncertainty regarding the use and goals of recognition, validation, and accreditation (RVA), and participants' acceptance and perception of such techniques. This research effort addresses this problem by exploring course participants' attitudes and levels of acceptance of non-formal learning recognition compared to traditional university credit in both developed and developing countries. The actual study uses both certificates of completion and digital badges to recognize and validate learning in an introductory, university level course in web programming using HTML5/CSS. The course is available to anyone, but was specifically marketed to participants from Sweden and Kenya. Empirical data was gathered using interviews and online surveys in the course. The preliminary results are that participants from developing countries value digital recognition to a greater extent than their counterparts in Europe. However, both Swedes and Kenyans see open courses with digital recognition as a complement to traditional learning to individually construct an education. © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84938152650&doi=10.1109%2fFIE.2014.7044389&partnerID=40&md5=3c44b4bc8f0b799f2db430d184009c92,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"44th Annual Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE 2014",,,

With nearly 24,000 enrolled as of early 2015, it is the largest astronomy MOOC available. The astronomical numbers enrolled do not translate into a similar level of engagement. The content consists of 14 hours of video lecture, nearly 1,000 Powerpoint slides, 250 pages of background readings, and 20 podcast interviews with leading researchers. Perhaps in part because of the large amount of course content, the overall completion rate is low, about 3%. However, this number was four times higher for an early cohort of learners who were selected to have a prior interest in astronomy and who took the class in synchronous mode, with new content being added every week. Completion correlates with engagement as measured by posts to the online discussion board. For a subset of learners, social media like Facebook and Twitter provide an additional, important mode of engagement. For the asynchronous learners who have continuously enrolled for the past 15 months, those who complete the course do so quickly, with few persisting longer than two months. The availability of a free completion certificate had no impact on completion rates when it was added midway through the period of data analyzed in this paper.

However, there was less satisfaction regarding student- instructor (8; 32%) and student-student (5; 20%) interactions. Conclusions: About one-fifth of Egyptian medical undergraduates have heard about MOOCs with only about 6.5% actively enrolled in courses. Students who actively participated showed a positive attitude towards the experience, but better time-management skills and faster Internet connection speeds are required.

Scopus,Article,Klobas J.E.,Measuring the success of scaleable open online courses,2014,"Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to propose measures of online open course success for noncommercial institutional providers of massive open online courses (MOOCs) and other scaleable open online courses (SOOCs).Design/methodology/approach – The measures are derived from the characteristics of open online courses, existing knowledge about open online course providers and users and their motivations, and current practice in MOOC evaluation and data analytics.Findings – Current practices for evaluation of open online courses are dominated by MOOC analytics which provide insights into user demographics and behaviour with some implications for evaluation of reach and course design but leaving many unknowns. Measures for evaluation of success at the institutional level can be derived from institutional goals for open online courses. Success from the point of view of teachers and technical teams involved in design, development and delivery of open online courses can be derived from team members’ expectations, resources and satisfaction as well as measures of cost and effort compared to budget and benchmarks. Users are classified as registrants (information seekers, window shoppers, samplers), downloaders and participants (starters, partial participants and full participants who are further divided into auditing, active and certificate takers); different measures are appropriate for each group.Practical implications – Practitioners and researchers must consider a variety of levels and indicators of success to adequately evaluate open online courses.

However, there is very little research exploring MOOCs in the discipline of health and medicine. Objective: We aim to provide a review of MOOCs related to health and medicine offered by various MOOC platforms in 2013, by analyzing and comparing the various offerings, their target audience, typical length of course, and credentials offered. We also discuss opportunities and challenges presented by MOOCs in health and medicine. Methods: Health and medicine-related MOOCs were gathered using several methods to ensure the richness and completeness of data. Identified MOOC platform websites were used to gather the lists of offerings. In parallel, these MOOC platforms were contacted to access official data on their offerings. Two MOOC aggregator sites (Class Central and MOOC List) were also consulted to gather data on MOOC offerings. Eligibility criteria were defined to concentrate on the courses that were offered in 2013 and primarily on the subject of health and medicine. All language translations in this paper were done using Google Translate. Results: The search identified 225 courses, of which 98 were eligible for the review. Over half (58%, 57/98) of the MOOCs considered were offered on the Coursera platform, and 94% (92/98) of all the MOOCs were offered in English. Universities offered 90 MOOCs, and the John Hopkins University offered the largest number of MOOCs (12/90). Only three MOOCs were offered by developing countries (China, West Indies, and Saudi Arabia). The duration of MOOCs varied from 3-20 weeks with an average length of 6.7 weeks. On average, MOOCs expected a participant to work on the material for 4.2 hours a week. Verified certificates were offered by 14 MOOCs, while three others offered other professional recognition. Conclusions: The review presents evidence to suggest that MOOCs can be used as a way to provide continuous medical education.

The success of these massive courses is based on involving students to acquire knowledge and skills in a wider community by learning from others and using active learning practices. MOOC providers also help universities to support the mission of transferring knowledge to society in any kind of area, supporting lifelong learning and adopting some kind of internationalization strategy. This is an ongoing trend where 17 of top 30 universities in the world's adopted MOOC courses. Open learning is a strategic and valuable trend in knowledge society. Opportunities appear in the Anglo and Latin American market, while problems associated with the high drop-out rate, the sustainability, and the feasibility of skill certification should be addressed.

In this paper, the aim is to observe MOOC in their natural setting to examine a particular community of MOOC by drawing on the concepts of communities of practice as a theoretical lens. One of the most significant current discussions on MOOC is Coursera. Questions have been raised about the structure of an emergent type of community within MOOC. However, far too little attention has been paid to study community of practice in this type of online education. The authors conducted an online ethnographic study on a sample of discussion forums of Coursera. Discussions were qualitatively content analyzed in order to understand the structure of an emergent type of community within MOOC. Our findings suggest that cohesion in a MOOC community is brought about by the domain of doubts, questions, new knowledge, experiences and the community of learners who meet people around the world with similar interests; the practices of documents, information, ideas, stories, experiences and software sharing.

MOOCs are considered a means for democratizing education. These courses will hopefully provide an opportunity for individuals to learn from the best educators in the world, as well as help expand their personal networks, and facilitate their career development. However, research thus far shows that the majority of people taking advantage of these courses are already employed, have post-secondary degrees, and have encountered few barriers related to the affordability of higher education. Little is known about MOOC learners with financial constraints and who do not fit the typical profile of MOOC learners. This paper presents the results of the analysis of data from six Coursera courses offered by the University of Michigan from fall 2012 through winter 2013. In this analysis learners who self-identified as being unable to afford to pursue a formal education (the target group) were contrasted to other learners (the comparison group) in terms of demographics, motivations, course enrollment, engagement and performance. Learners in the target group were primarily male and over 25 years old. A statistically significant portion of the target group held less than a 4-year college degree than the comparison group. Target learners were also significantly underrepresented in the enrollment of the courses examined here. Although the comparison group had a significantly higher completion rate overall than the target group, the target group had a statistically significant higher rate of completing courses with certificates of distinction. This article provides a discussion of these results and suggests how MOOCs could be adapted to better address the needs of learners who feel financially unable to pursue a more traditional path to a post-secondary education. © Dillahunt, Wang, Teasley.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84908644443&doi=10.19173%2firrodl.v15i5.1841&partnerID=40&md5=36e083dd4ff62327963e9246f2e42b04,International Review of Research in Open and Distance Learning,Athabasca University,,,,

The practical aim of this project was to create, implement, and evaluate a platform about human rights that was available to any Kenyan for free in order to increase knowledge and engagement. Therefore, a non-formal massive open online course (MOOC) about human rights was designed and launched. The course was free and open to anyone in Kenya and offered both a digital badge and certificate from Stockholm University in Sweden upon completion. The course was called Haki Zangu (Kiswahili for ""My Rights""), and it explored how using incentives such as a digital badge and certificate of completion affected learning outcomes. This course offered ubiquitous access based on principles of responsive web design and used audio recordings of the entire course content. The course is perpetual and still on-going, but after six months there were 160 participants who had enrolled, and ten participants had completed the course and received certificates and digital badges. The participants showed extensive enthusiasm and engagement for human rights issues, and they expressed desires to learn more and further spread knowledge about human rights. The current findings suggest that the availability of digital badges and certificates increased interest for participation and positively affected learning outcomes. Moreover, the use of a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) format with incentives proved successful, combined with the contextualization and accessibility of the course content. Furthermore, the technical platform proved adequate for disseminating education for free in a developing country, and allowed for unencumbered access regardless of device.

The current higher education system cannot satisfy this need in many fields, e.g. Gartner predicts, that already in 2015 only a third of jobs for big data analysts can be filled [2]. The rapid development of Information and Communication Technology (ITC, IT) has changed many aspects of teaching and learning. Educational materials are moving into cloud(s) and degrees are given on-line ('Master's Degree Online Directory' lists over 90,000 programs [3]), old-fashioned Colleges and Universities with large campus, staff and high costs are getting more and more competition from numerous educational entrepreneurs, who start massive open online courses (MOOC) with millions of users/students from all around the world; they establish new on-line universities where costs of obtaining a degree are marginal compared to 'brick-and-mortal' universities and which are open to nearly everyone independent of user geographical location. Until now MOOC have not yet proved their value-less than 4% of enrollees complete the courses [4] and they do not receive (yet) university diploma. But the World most prestigious technical university, MIT, has already set up a certification system - students who can master the subjects taught in MOOC receive an official certificate of completion [5]. Although these certificates will not carry the weight of a traditional MIT diploma (they will be issued by started by MIT online learning initiative called MITx), but the word 'MIT' alone carries a weight. When speaking about possibilities of IT in education most speakers/writers are excitedly discussing technology-servers, communication lines, bandwidth, security (preferably all in thick cloud of technical jargon). Nearly nobody presents practical experience, suggestions and/or theories about how to teach with this new technology in order best to utilize its possibilities. The 'education in the cloud' mainly consists of video clips trying to repeat the classroom experience: recorded before the old-fashioned blackboard (only nowadays it is white), where professor is presenting the same lecture what he presented in lecture hall, only now lectures are cut into 5-10 min video clips - the 'mobile approach'. Is this why the old lecture halls are still needed? Rapidly increasing costs of University Education, increasing competition of educational entrepreneurs and constant increase of population of working students have made clear, that both sides of University education - teaching/learning and accrediting, giving diplomas need changes. University Education should more take into account students informal and non-formal learning, their participation in professional work - both in organization of study and in certification.

In this paper, a review of the current published literature focusing on the use of MOOCs by instructors or students was conducted. Our primary goal in doing this is to summarize the accumulated state of knowledge concerning the main motivations and challenges of using MOOCs, as well as to identify issues that have yet to be fully addressed or resolved. Our findings suggest four reasons why students sign up for MOOCs: the desire to learn about a new topic or to extend current knowledge, they were curious about MOOCs, for personal challenge, and the desire to collect as many completion certificates as possible. Up to 90% drop out due to reasons including a lack of incentive, failure to understand the content material and having no one to turn to for help, and having other priorities to fulfill. Findings suggest three main reasons why instructors wish to teach MOOCs: being motivated by a sense of intrigue, the desire to gain some personal (egoistic) rewards, or a sense of altruism. Four key challenges of teaching MOOCs are also surfaced: difficulty in evaluating students' work, having a sense of speaking into a vacuum due to the absence of student immediate feedback, being burdened by the heavy demands of time and money, and encountering a lack of student participation in online forums. We conclude by discussing two issues that have yet to be fully resolved - the quality of MOOC education, and the assessment of student work. © 2014.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84903174776&doi=10.1016%2fj.edurev.2014.05.001&partnerID=40&md5=71eb6cec1aa67187754729daa7c51171,Educational Research Review,Elsevier Ltd,,,,

Scopus,Conference Paper,"Guo P.J., Reinecke K.",Demographic differences in how students navigate through MOOCs,2014,"The current generation of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) attract a diverse student audience from all age groups and over 196 countries around the world. Researchers, educators, and the general public have recently become interested in how the learning experience in MOOCs differs from that in traditional courses. A major component of the learning experience is how students navigate through course content. This paper presents an empirical study of how students navigate through MOOCs, and is, to our knowledge, the first to investigate how navigation strategies differ by demographics such as age and country of origin. We performed data analysis on the activities of 140, 546 students in four edX MOOCs and found that certificate earners skip on average 22% of the course content, that they frequently employ non-linear navigation by jumping backward to earlier lecture sequences, and that older students and those from countries with lower student-teacher ratios are more comprehensive and non-linear when navigating through the course. From these findings, we suggest design recommendations such as for MOOC platforms to develop more detailed forms of certification that incentivize students to deeply engage with the content rather than just doing the minimum necessary to earn a passing grade. Finally, to enable other researchers to reproduce and build upon our findings, we have made our data set and analysis scripts publicly available.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84899666806&doi=10.1145%2f2556325.2566247&partnerID=40&md5=f01b6c4bb7511c0c591b94c38b22c537,L@S 2014 - Proceedings of the 1st ACM Conference on Learning at Scale,Association for Computing Machinery,"1st ACM Conference on Learning at Scale, L@S 2014",,,

Universities and colleges worldwide increasingly use online platforms to offer courses open to the public. Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) give millions of people access to education from prestigious universities. Although some courses provide certification of attendance and completion, most do not provide any academic or professional recognition since this would imply a rigorous and complete evaluation of the student's achievements. Since the number of students enrolled may exceed tens of thousands, it is impractical for a lecturer (or group of lecturers) to evaluate all students using conventional hand marking. To be scalable, assessment must be automated. State-of-the-art automated assessment includes multiple choice questions and intelligent marking techniques (involving complex semantic analysis). However, none of these alone can cope with very large student populations of students and guarantee the evaluation quality required for higher education. The goal of this research is to create and evaluate a computer mediated social interaction system for massive online learning communities. This must be scalable and able to assess fairly and accurately student coursework and examinations. We call this approach ""machine and socially intelligent peer assessment"". We describe our system and illustrate its application. It combines peer assessment and reputation systems to provide independent computerised assessment. Assignment of student markers to scripts is based on reputation scores which emerge from their marking behaviour. A simulation experiment shows how reputation-based social structure evolves in our peer marking system. A pilot experiment with ninety 16-year old high school students in Colombia tested the marking accuracy of our system by comparing the statistical differences between teacher-marked 'gold standard' scores, peer assessment using average scores, and our intelligent reputation-based peer assessment. The research question is to what extent does the proposed approach improve peer marking in terms of marking accuracy and fairness?

Scopus,Conference Paper,"Farrell S., Rucinski A.",A service science context in education driven by disruptive innovation and the Internet of Things,2013,"Global Engineering is the last frontier in education. It creates a dilemma of providing engineering education anywhere in the World, preserving local cultural values, and applying it anywhere around the Globe. A recent Singapore Declaration [ASEE Global Forum, 2009], and consecutive World Engineering Education Forums, [1] paved the roadmap towards Global Engineering calling for practical solutions to implement the vision of a global engineer. In response to these challenges, several 'disruptive innovation' [Christensen, 1995] solutions such as Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC) and Massive Open Online Laboratories (MOOL) have been introduced including the one based on the Internet of Things (IOT) and disruptive microelectronics [2]. Disruptive Microelectronics which includes embedded systems, Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC), Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA), and (Programmable Systems On a Chip (PSOC), is one of excellent case studies of disruptive technologies (or disruptive innovation) which is defined as an innovation that helps create a new market and value network, and eventually goes on to disrupt an existing market and value network (over a few years or decades), displacing an earlier technology. The Internet of Things is the next generation of the Internet connecting objects, not just people. Since the ultimate goal is to produce new industries globally, understanding, measuring, evaluating, and preserving the integrity of global engineering becomes fundamental. The latter is proposed to be addressed by Quality Assessment (QA) of emerging global engineering curricula and scholars involved in teaching of global engineering. For example, International Society for Engineering Education (IGIP) is one of the leaders providing international certification of scholars and one of the frontrunners in fostering engineering on line, critical for global engineering. The overall process of global engineering education addressing essential skills for engineers from any country to be competitive in an international market for engineering knowhow, with skills not longer limited to cultural sensitivity needed only for product design destined for diverse markets can be superbly captured by Service Science [Spohrer, 2008]. Service science is an interdisciplinary paradigm to the study, design, and implementation of complex systems in which specific arrangements of people and technologies take actions that provide value for others [3]. It is also a proposed academic discipline and research area that would complement multiplicity of disciplines that contribute to knowledge about service. The interdisciplinary nature of the field calls for a curriculum and competencies to advance the development and contribution of the field of service science using so called the T-Shape curricula as shown in Figure 1. The vertical bar in T represents the depth of knowledge a student is majoring in whereas the horizontal bar corresponds to the multidisciplinary knowledge gained by the student. The proposed IOT based curricula corresponds to the service science platform represented by a modified T-Shape diagram surrounded by the circle representing the IOT universe as depicted in Figure 2. The model solution of Online Engineering is motivated by: (1) the search for Cost Effective and 'Democratic' Online Engineering; (2) the definition of Global Engineering Solution. Furthermore, the approach is based on Disruptive Education, as defined by Christensen, and the underlying technology is derived from the Internet of Things defined as a Web of Objects (Rao, 2010). The Web of Objects (WOO) is a superset of the Internet of Things which enables, as stated above, worldwide interaction among objects without human intervention as well as the Internet, a classic medium facilitating communication among people. The presented Online Engineering platform, called WOO3©, is a triple WOO based model and ecosystem (WOO3©) which includes: (1) IOT based eLearning; (2) IOT based subject matters; and (3) IOT based online engineering. The service science context of the proposed meta level global range curricula development can be concisely depicted in Figure 3. The Internet of Things based curricula (the center of Figure 3) function as an enabler and accelerator for transforming existing curricula represented by the original Vitruvian Man on the left of Figure 3 into a monetary version of the Vitruvian man depicted on a one Euro Italian coin shown on the right side of Figure 3. The latter symbolizes the creation of new services generated by global engineering. The QA component of the proposed curricula is derived from the existing IGIP system for certification already in place. IGIP ING PAED Certification supports institutional and programmatic accreditation by providing an opportunity for engineering educators to obtain the pedagogical expertise that enables them to design modernized courses and curricula, employ sound pedagogic practice in the classroom, and produce students who will possess the skills required to by industrial constituents and to become the global engineers of the 21st Century. Consequently, engineering on line and on line engineering practices are being introduced to provide a technology platform enabling more accessible curricula. The curricula may emphasize engineering topics across multiple engineering disciplines, non-engineering topics such as English, or a mixture of both. It is also important to add that the IGIP ING PAED Certification is relying on local academic heritage as much as possible to preserve both cultural and traditional assets of pedagogical practices. IGIP accredits training centers for 'International Engineering Educators', the teaching matter of which conforms to IGIP's curriculum for engineering pedagogy. The curriculum is proposed and developed by an institution or center according to the needs of regional educational systems and within the framework of the IGIP prototype curriculum. There are currently 42 IGIP-accredited ING PAED training centers in Europe, Asia and Brazil. The regional workshops may be particularly relevant in the following regions: Central Asia - A regional online certification program would support the current international accreditation effort through the QUEECA (Quality Assurance in Engineering Education in Central Asia) project, Building on an existing IGIP ING.PAED certification program in Kazakhstan, a regional program could support certification in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. Seminars and workshops could be offered in conjunction with the Kazakhstan-Indo-US Collaboration for Engineering Education (KIUCEE). India - The Indo-US Collaboration for Engineering Education (IUCEE) is aiming to build a solid base for engineering education and research by strengthening the four pillars of education: learner-centric teaching; research excellence; outcomes based quality supported by accreditation; and innovation and entrepreneurship. [4] Latin America - The Latin American and Caribbean Consortium of Engineering Institutions (LACCEI) has designed a program for faculty development based on the International Society for Engineering Education (IGIP) curriculum. [5] The IGIP curriculum is a modular system which consists of core modules (8 Credit Points), and theory modules (4 CP) and practice modules (8 CP).

Open Educational Resources (OER) and Open Educational Practice (OEP) are mushrooming and Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC) are here already. The idea of moving away from battery-type Academic Development Activities and silo modules and programmes towards open cross-institutional approaches in line with OEP are explored within this paper based on a recent small-scale, fully-online study. This brought together academics and other professionals who support learning, from different disciplines and professional areas who are studying towards a Postgraduate Certificate (PgCert) in Teaching and Learning in HE/Academic Practice during a facilitated open Problem-Based Learning (PBL) task around assessment and feedback using freely available social media. The study aimed to explore if and how online PBL can be used within PgCert provisions to provide opportunities to connect, communicate and collaborate in a community of practice beyond institutional walls. The phenomenographic methodology underpinned this research. Participants' experiences in this open Academic Development activity were captured through individual remote interviews, a series of questionnaires and reflective accounts. Findings indicate that open online PBL has the potential to enable learners and educators to break out of academic and virtual silos. It also widens meaningful collaborative learning within Academic Development in multi-disciplinary and multi-institutional groups -something participants in this study commented extremely positively about. This provides evidence that freeing AD is the way forward to share available resources, and establish more organic and healthy learning communities beyond the module, programme and institutional level.

The MOOP framework consists of three major components: Automatic Cheating Detector (ACD), Peer Cheating Detector (PCD), and Final Review Committee (FRC). ACD uses webcam video or other sensors to monitor students and automatically flag suspected cheating behavior. Ambiguous cases are then sent to the PCD, where students peer-review flagged webcam video to confirm suspicious cheating behaviors. Finally, the list of suspicious cheating behaviors is sent to the FRC to make the final punishing decision. Our experiment show that ACD and PCD can detect usage of a cheat sheet with good accuracy and can reduce the overall human resources required to monitor MOOCs for cheating.",,PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2015 ACM INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER-SUPPORTED COOPERATIVE WORK AND SOCIAL COMPUTING (CSCW'15),ACM International Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing (CSCW),ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,,,

WebOfScience,Article,"Danka, I",Motivation by gamification: Adapting motivational tools of massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) for peer-to-peer assessment in connectivist massive open online courses (cMOOCs),2020,"In the first decade of the 21st century, distance learning (usually subject to course fees and resulting in formal certification) was complemented by free-of-charge open learning courses with unlimited numbers of participants and no final certificate. Termed massive open online courses (MOOCs), these soon fell into different categories, depending on their concept. Among them are connectivist massive open online courses (cMOOCs) which emphasise a collaborative approach to learning. However, while initial enrolment is indeed massive, completion rates are very low and cMOOCs notoriously lack an appropriate method of evaluating learning progress and motivational resources. The author of this article suggests that one way of addressing this problem might be to adapt motivational formative assessment tools used in massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) to cMOOCs. He argues that some characteristics of MMORPGs can be effectively incorporated in cMOOCs, thus benefiting from the motivational potential of MMORPGs. He cautions, however, that even if MMORPGs (and ongoing, low-stakes formative assessment in general) are motivational, they can only be applied to cMOOCs if the idea of formative assessment is not in tension with connectivist principles. Hence, the author argues for their compatibility, and builds on peer-to-peer assessment as a solution for resource allocation problems with low instructor-learner ratio.",,INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF EDUCATION,,SPRINGERNATURE,,,

Indeed, MOOCs have managed to help huge numbers of online users, especially in higher education sector, to attend free courses and get certificates. Open Educational Resources (OERs) can be used in different ways in the learning practices because the concept of openness and reusability of these resources encourages many stakeholders to use these resources in online and massive courses. The main challenge faced by many experiments in using OERs in MOOCs is how to enhance interaction between students and educational content. Thus, there is an urgent need to address this challenge by building and maintaining links between these kinds of courses and the provided OERs by other universities. The specific objective of this paper was to propose a model for using OERs through the current MOOCs. Data for this study were collected by reviewing previous related work and models to present this model in three main Phases: Pre-using OERs, Using OERs, and sustaining of OERs.

Open Educational Resources (OER) and Open Educational Practice (OEP) are mushrooming and Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC) are here already. The idea of moving away from battery-type Academic Development Activities and silo modules and programmes towards open cross-institutional approaches in line with OEP are explored within this paper based on a recent small-scale, fully-online study. This brought together academics and other professionals who support learning, from different disciplines and professional areas who are studying towards a Postgraduate Certificate (PgCert) in Teaching and Learning in HE/Academic Practice during a facilitated open Problem-Based Learning (PBL) task around assessment and feedback using freely available social media. The study aimed to explore if and how online PBL can be used within PgCert provisions to provide opportunities to connect, communicate and collaborate in a community of practice beyond institutional walls. The phenomenographic methodology underpinned this research. Participants' experiences in this open Academic Development activity were captured through individual remote interviews, a series of questionnaires and reflective accounts. Findings indicate that open online PBL has the potential to enable learners and educators to break out of academic and virtual silos. It also widens meaningful collaborative learning within Academic Development in multi-disciplinary and multi-institutional groups - something participants in this study commented extremely positively about. This provides evidence that freeing AD is the way forward to share available resources, and establish more organic and healthy learning communities beyond the module, programme and institutional level.

This article proposes a predictive modeling tool with several Machine Learning algorithms (for generating Predictive Models) and feature engineering in MOOCs data integrated to contribute research to this specific issue. The proposed tool predicts two situations: which learners are likely to leave the course (dropout) and which learners are expected to pass the course (certificate acquisition).

At the present time much attention of the society is fixed more and more to the problem of qualification improvement of pedagogical staff on account of total informatization of society, cardinal technological changes, becoming stronger interrelation of education, science and production, and active introduction in practice of professional standards. The existing system of professional development of pedagogical staff stands in need of reorganization and modernization. The search of the formats corresponding to modern realities, models and technologies of continuous training and retraining of education experts is becoming urgent today. The aim of the article is to show the possibilities of innovative forms of distance learning, realized in the form of a massive open online course (MOOC), for the training and continuous training of pedagogical staff. Methodology and research methods. The methods involve system-based analysis, synthesis, and generalization. Results and scientific novelty. The concept mass open online course (MOOC) is clarified. MOOC is considered as a form of electronic distance training carried out on the basis of educational multimedia content, and wherein a large number of participants are involved online. The advantages of MOOC in the organization of hybrid forms of distance learning are shown: these online courses enable to combine planned online interactions of students with lecturers and tutors; mass discussions on topical professional subjects; offline study of records of training materials, and independent participants' online coursework. The model of professional development of pedagogical staff on the basis of MOOC and realization of the principles of open education is presented: open platform, open schedule, open training, and open certification. The main approaches to the formation of new educational environment based on MOOC are designated as an innovative platform of preparation and professional development of pedagogical staff. The experience of Togliatti State University of MOOC approbation is briefly summarized. Practical significance. The authors consider MOOC as a future-oriented form of e-learning in network professional communities.

Universities and colleges worldwide increasingly use online platforms to offer courses open to the public. Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) give millions of people access to education from prestigious universities. Although some courses provide certification of attendance and completion, most do not provide any academic or professional recognition since this would imply a rigorous and complete evaluation of the student's achievements. Since the number of students enrolled may exceed tens of thousands, it is impractical for a lecturer (or group of lecturers) to evaluate all students using conventional hand marking. To be scalable, assessment must be automated. State-of-the-art automated assessment includes multiple choice questions and intelligent marking techniques (involving complex semantic analysis). However, none of these alone can cope with very large student populations of students and guarantee the evaluation quality required for higher education. The goal of this research is to create and evaluate a computer mediated social interaction system for massive online learning communities. This must be scalable and able to assess fairly and accurately student coursework and examinations. We call this approach machine and socially intelligent peer assessment. We describe our system and illustrate its application. It combines peer assessment and reputation systems to provide independent computerised assessment. Assignment of student markers to scripts is based on reputation scores which emerge from their marking behaviour. A simulation experiment shows how reputation-based social structure evolves in our peer marking system. A pilot experiment with ninety 16-year old high school students in Colombia tested the marking accuracy of our system by comparing the statistical differences between teacher-marked 'gold standard' scores, peer assessment using average scores, and our intelligent reputation-based peer assessment. The research question is to what extent does the proposed approach improve peer marking in terms of marking accuracy and fairness?

In this article, it is described the author's development of two massive open online courses: Russian language from scratch and Verbs of movement in Russian, consisting of thematically related topics/modules, video presentations, annotated lectures, generalizing and vetting tasks, lexical and grammatical tests after each topic of the training course and the final test. To analyze the language material and structure of the presented online courses, General logical and General scientific research methods were used. The authors also focused their attention on the benefits of the MOOC The Russian language from scratch, which includes a stepped introduction of lexical and grammatical units, the necessary explanations in Russian and opted for independent distance learning of foreign citizens who speak English and want to start learning the Russian language.

WebOfScience,Proceedings Paper,"Naji, K; Abdelali, I",Adaptive MOOC Supports the Elicitation of Learners' Preferences,2020,"Given higher education in Morocco suffers from the increasing number of students in institutions with open access policy, the issue of language and communication, the heterogeneous academic level of students, the inability to adapt schedules for students, the evolution of new technologies, etc., innovative pedagogy has become a necessity to address these challenges. Additionally, new modes of adaptive learning need to be designed to develop innovative training programs. Many authors agree that innovation in pedagogy concerns everything that is not part of formal education (Lison et al. 2014). In 2016, the Ministry of National Education, Vocational Training, Higher Education and Scientific Research in collaboration with GIP FUN MOOC, and the French Embassy signed an agreement to establish a platform MUN Morocco Digital University. The purpose of the agreement is to encourage Moroccan Universities to develop Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), Small Private Online Courses (SPOCs), and other forms of online courses and to reinforce partnership with French Universities in e-learning. MOOCs were developed in 2008, and after four years of operation, the New York Times considered 2012 The year of the MOOC. Since then, new features of MOOCs have motivated decision makers in higher education from across the world to create a number of online courses in their institutions. However, the weakness of MOOCs as a pedagogical innovation is the high dropout rate. Despite being massive courses, of thousands of enrollees, 50% quit after one week, 10% finish the course after completing all the modules, and only 4% obtain a certificate (Perna et al, Life Cycle of a Million MOOC Users. MOOC Research Initiative.Arlington, Texas, 2013). Given MOOCs are large-scale learning platforms that have failed to meet learners' individual needs, considering this innovative pedagogy effective enough is conditional on adapting instruction to enhance student learning, learner's characteristics, for example, knowledge or personal interests. In fact, why not implement adaptive learning techniques to further customize MOOCs? The purpose of this study is twofold. First, it aims to uncover the feasibility of adaptive learning on MOOCs in higher education in Morocco. Second, this investigation seeks to address the effects of adaptive learning on student learning outcomes, student engagement, and drop-out rates.",,ADVANCED INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT (AI2SD'2019): VOL 1 - ADVANCED INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS FOR EDUCATION AND INTELLIGENT LEARNING SYSTEM,2nd International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Systems for Sustainable Development (AI2SD),SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,,,

A qualitative study using semi-structured interviews was undertaken with participants on the PGCert to investigate learner experiences of both the MOOC and PGCert, and to establish the extent to which the MOOC supported learners' transitions into the PGCert in terms of their (1) foundation knowledge, (2) study skills, (3) digital literacies, (4) readiness for self-directed learning, and to determine whether additional efforts could have been directed to more effectively support student transitions. Findings revealed that the MOOC informed participants' decision to undertake the fully online PGCert, and that this was due to the effective learning design and a strong teacher presence throughout. The participants already possessed some background knowledge and a number of essential learning skills (though not uniformly), questioning assumptions around MOOCs as an aid to widening participation in higher education; however, the MOOC helped to enhance and unify these. Not surprisingly, there were some challenges encountered on entering online postgraduate study that the MOOC design could not anticipate or solve; therefore, we recommend that online learners are appropriately supported throughout their studies. This work has implications in terms of how MOOCs may help facilitate student transitions into other fully online, credit-bearing programmes of study.",,RESEARCH IN LEARNING TECHNOLOGY,,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,,,

Using conservative thresholds, we estimate CAMEO prevalence at 1237 certificates, accounting for 1.3% of the certificates in the 69 MOOCs with CAMEO users. Among earners of 20 or more certificates, 25% have used the CAMEO strategy. CAMEO users are more likely to be young, male, and international than other MOOC certificate earners.

Other student variables were found to have a positive impact on survival that persisted throughout the entire course: U.S. location, higher age, an intention to complete, better English skills, prior familiarity with the subject, motivation to earn a certificate, and score and time spent on the previous problem set (homework).

Not only does DEER provide a means to certify that course goals have been met, it also provides MOOC participants with the opportunity to share information about what they have learned with others at the local level.",,PROCEEDINGS OF THE THIRD (2016) ACM CONFERENCE ON LEARNING @ SCALE (L@S 2016),3rd Annual ACM Conference on Learning at Scale (L at S),ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,,,

Massive Online Open Courses (MOOCs) can provide a platform to enable such skill development programs at scale. The IITBombayX course, Basic 3D animation using Blender (SKANI101x), was the first of its kind offering of a Skill Development MOOC (sdMOOC) for the Indian learners. Over its two offerings, 6457 participants registered, 2465 (38%) were active and 1132 (19%) were certified. However while producing and conducting the course we realized the lack of content creation and pedagogic strategies for such sdMOOCs. Analysis of our pilot offering of SKANI101x, highlighted its effectiveness for both, first-time and experienced online learners. In the second offering we modified pedagogic strategies to foster student-instructor interactions that resulted in higher engagement and completion rate. This paper discusses the rationale of the decisions and reports an evaluation study of participants' performance, engagement, and perceptions regarding the components of the course over two offerings.

The grades students receive on these tests and assignments determine whether they complete or become certified in course material. However, beyond receiving a certification, how do grades impact the learning behavior in students? Do students who receive poor grades actively change their overall activity to improve their grades? To better understand the impact of grades, we observe overall student activity on two MITx MOOCs for certified students and students who continuously participate in MOOC assignments. We use click stream data to compile the overall activity of a student and we use points earned divided by total possible points to calculate the students' grades. We observe that students with the highest levels of activity have some of the highest grades. We also observe that the difference in activity before and after the finalization of a grade (delta-activity) have greater variation as grade increases.

MOOCs are online courses that are open to everyone and anyone to join with typically no limits to the number of participants or prerequisite qualifications. In some MOOCs there is an option to pay for a certificate upon completion. This chapter captures the use and future of MOOCs in the biomedical sciences. As the number of MOOCs available in biomedical subject areas grow, so do the number of participants taking these courses, with many of these learners and professionals looking to update their knowledge in the biomedical sciences. There is also a growing use of MOOCs in higher education as a recourse for campus degree programmes, known as hybrid MOOCs, where the MOOC provides the learning and the assessment is undertaken by the educational institution. The growing number of MOOCs available for credit is changing the way some learners are accessing higher education and the development of micro degrees obtained through the completion of a number of MOOCs may potentially change the way higher education is provided in the future. Finally, the potential of artificial intelligence to provide virtual classroom assistants is also a possible game changer, allowing more personalised learning to be delivered at scale.",,"BIOMEDICAL VISUALISATION, VOL 4",,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,,,

However, since only a small percentage of enrollees complete MOOCs, it is important to understand participants' preliminary expectations and motivations. This is particularly important for science and engineering MOOCs because they require professional knowledge, analytical skills, and the ability to handle abstract models of physical phenomena. Hence, the goal of this study was to examine the motivating factors of learners who successfully completed a MOOC in nanotechnology and nanosensors, while comparing between university-affiliated students (N = 114) and general participants (N = 194). Analysis of data, collected via an online survey, forum posts, and email messages, identified three motivational themes: career, personal, and educational. The findings indicated that participants from both groups were motivated by general interest, personal growth, and enrichment. However, while the university-affiliated students were oriented toward improving knowledge and receiving a certificate, the general participants were oriented toward research and professional advancement.

Specifically, technical support for goal-oriented and self-regulated learning to date is very limited in this context although both learning strategies are proven to be key factors for students' achievement in large-scale online learning environments. In this first investigation, a concept for the application and technical integration of personalized learning objectives in a MOOC platform is realized and assessed. It is evaluated with a mixed-method approach. First, the learners' acceptance is examined with a multivariate A/B test in two courses.

To figure out the underlying reasons, in this paper, we make two key contributions. First, we find that being an examinee for a learner is almost a necessary condition of earning a certificate and hence investigation of the examinee rate prediction is of great importance. Second, after conducting extensive investigation of participants' operation behaviours, we carefully select a set of features that are closely reflect participants' learning behaviours. We apply existing commonly used classifiers over three online courses, generously provided by China University MOOC platform, to evaluate the effectiveness of the used features.

It is termed CAMEO Copying Answers using Multiple Existence Online. A person using CAMEO sets up one or more harvesting accounts for collecting correct answers; these are then submitted in the user's master account for credit. The study has three main goals: Determining the prevalence of CAMEO, studying its detailed characteristics, and inferring the motivation(s) for using it. For the physics course that we studied, about 10% of the certificate earners used this method to obtain more than 1% of their correct answers, and more than 3% of the certificate earners used it to obtain the majority (> 50%) of their correct answers. We discuss two of the likely consequences of CAMEO: jeopardizing the value of MOOC certificates as academic credentials, and generating misleading conclusions in educational research. Based on our study, we suggest methods for reducing CAMEO. Although this study was conducted on a MOOC, CAMEO can be used in any learning environment that enables students to have multiple accounts.

Additionally, the probability that a student obtains the course certificate increases dramatically (3x higher) when she has one or more certificate friends. Moreover, we develop a unified model to predict students' learning effectiveness, by incorporating user demographics, forum activities, and learning behavior.

We discuss how an online messaging system might tailor information to individual students using predictive analytics. The proposed system would be data-driven and quantitative; e.g., a message might furnish the probability that a student will successfully complete the certificate requirements of a massive open online course. Repeated messages would prod underperforming students and alert instructors to those in need of intervention. Administrators responsible for accreditation or outcomes assessment would have ready documentation of learning outcomes and actions taken to address unsatisfactory student performance. The article's brief introduction to statistical predictive models sets the stage for a description of the messaging system.

Unlike traditional courses, MOOCs require additional skills, provided by videographers, instructional designers, IT specialists and platform specialists. Over the past few years several Universities facilitated partnership with MOOCs providers and are building MOOC courses, to serve as e-learning versions of their courses. Despite all the advantages offered by the MOOC courses, the current statistics show that only a very limited number of registered learners are completing the course. And the vast majority are stopping learning at an early stage. The main reason can be found in the lack of motivation of the students to pass the exams to become a certificate, because universities do not accept the certificates for credits. The aim of this paper is to study the readiness of students to take MOOC courses on one hand and the acceptance of MOOC courses in Universities. A study is conducted on two Universities, Hasselt University, Belgium and Princess Sumaya University for Technology, Jordan. The results of the study are promising, as they suggest that such virtual study programs are accepted in both Universities.

However, when utilizing the knowledge from MOOCs, learners need to go through a number of hurdles-getting course completion certification (MS Global Learning Consortum: An example of LIP accessibility information, IMS Global Learning Consortium Inc., 2001, [10]) from various providers, get recognition of the knowledge level of a MOOC in the related domain, and make it searchable for various purposes. In this paper, we propose a MOOC course certifying agency framework, which merges learners' profiles from various MOOC providers so consolidated profiles are available in one place. Standards such as IMS LIP and Dublin Core (Feigenbaum and Prud' Hommeaux in SPARQL by example: a tutorial, Cambridge Semantics, 2011, [5]) are adopted and expanded to describe relate MOOC course profiles, learner profiles, learning goals, and related skill sets. It enables matching of qualified learner profiles for a job position and/or to identify a set of related MOOC course profiles for some learning goal. The potential employers look for a matching skill set from converged learner profiles through the agency. Each skill for the position goes through a mapping procedure with a corresponding MOOC course profile. After mapping skills to corresponding MOOCs, the framework searches for the converged profiles.

WebOfScience,Proceedings Paper,"Stephen, R; Yi, J",BUSINESSES ARE RAPIDLY ADOPTING MOOC'S-UNIVERSITIES AREN'T-WHAT CAN BE DONE?,2019,"A glance at the academic literature on Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) would convince anyone that the topic is one of the most visible issues in education technology, especially in postsecondary education. In spite of the high profile, MOOCs, in aggregate, have barely penetrated the online course offerings at colleges and universities. They are treated as experimental, unique, and relatively threatening interventions, often shunned by full-time faculty and ignored by administrators. Yet globally MOOCs have tens of millions of users in other sectors, such as skills and expertise assessment and micro credentials, and have a growing base of online learners who frequently avail themselves of MOOC-based short courses. Many businesses are diversifying from traditional methods of marketing, branding and client education to MOOC-facilitated interventions at an ever-increasing rate. But in the case of for-credit online courses in postsecondary education, MOOCs have not been popular, yielding instead to locally prepared and delivered course offerings. This is surprising because MOOCs were originally expected to be a dominant force in the online sector in higher education. This article examines three aspects of this peculiar problem. First, we present an overview of the current penetration of MOOCs in postsecondary education, taking note of the worldwide breadth of offerings, particularly in the sciences, but also in the arts, religion, economics, and more. Yet this impressive list of MOOC successes masks the fact that they are mostly offered piecemeal, not as full programmatic elements, resulting in MOOCs being but a tiny fraction of all online offerings in college today. In the United States, for example, about one-third of the 20 million college students are taking at least one course online, and one-sixth are taking all of their courses online, but only about one student in a thousand is obtaining academic credits through MOOCs. Next, we briefly summarize the amazing size and scope of MOOCs worldwide and the growth of some of the top MOOC developers. One of them, Coursera, already serves over 35 million learners. One of the reasons MOOCs have become so pervasive is an early characteristic that has continued to be part of the value equation: offering free versions of most courses. These free courses have become a vehicle for broadly defining the MOOC brand and also for financial success for developers, as learners moved to versions that charge a fee, often giving a certificate or badge or other evidence of achieving competency. We summarize some of the many successes of MOOCs outside the Academy-certificates, micro credentials, badges, and a variety of successful uses in the business world, generally described as Corporate Open Online Courses, COOCs. Finally, we suggest a possible solution to the problem, now being pursued by several of the largest MOOCs developers. It is a risky approach which takes advantage of the high customer/learner populations offered by universities and MOOC developers. This approach suggests a long-term trajectory whereby MOOCs can be a major instrument in reducing the unit cost of a college education, in a way that has been impossible so far for Online Program Management (OPM) vendors-delivering entire academic programs at significantly lower process. There are several significant MOOC projects already achieving this objective. The long-term implication of this approach is drastic tuition reductions, and a new era for MOOCs in higher education.",,"13TH INTERNATIONAL TECHNOLOGY, EDUCATION AND DEVELOPMENT CONFERENCE (INTED2019)","13th International Technology, Education and Development Conference (INTED)",IATED-INT ASSOC TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION & DEVELOPMENT,,,

We adapt reliability theory to model certificate completion rates with a Weibull survival function, following the intuition that students survive in a course for a certain time before stochastically dropping out. Course-course interactions are found to be well described by a single parameter for user engagement that can be estimated from a user's registration profile. User engagement, in turn, correlates with certificate rates in all courses regardless of specific content. The reliability approach is shown to capture several certificate rate patterns that are overlooked by conventional regression models.

Even though they provide several benefits, there are still some criticisms of MOOCs. For instance, MOOCs' high dropout rates or predominantly elite participation are considered to be important problems. In order to develop solutions for these problems, a deeper understanding of MOOCs is required. Today, despite the availability of several research studies about MOOCs, there is a shortage of in-depth research on course characteristics, learner characteristics, and predictors of certification rates. This study examined MOOC and learner characteristics in detail and explored the predictors of course certification rates based on data from 122 Massachusetts Institute of Technology MOOCs (MITx) on edX platform as well as data about the 2.8 million participants registered in these MOOCs. The results indicated that as the number of courses offered and the number of learners enrolled increased in years, there was a decrease in the certification rates among enrolled learners. According to our results, the number of average chapters completed, total forum messages, and mean age predicted course certification rates positively. On the other hand, the total number of chapters in a course predicted the course certification rates negatively. Based on these results, shorter and more interactive MOOCs are recommended by considering the needs of the learners, course content design, and strategies encouraging the enrolled students to enter the courses.",,INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF RESEARCH IN OPEN AND DISTRIBUTED LEARNING,,ATHABASCA UNIV PRESS,,,

AimThis study was undertaken to evaluate the strength of and the opportunities for implementing evidence-based nursing practice across a diverse 9-hospital system located in the mid-Atlantic region. MethodsA cross-sectional survey of 6,800 registered nurses (RNs), with a 24% response rate, was conducted to learn about their attitudes, beliefs, and perceptions toward organizational readiness and implementation of EBP. ResultsAlthough respondents' beliefs about EBP were positive, they reported their ability to implement EBP as extremely low. More than one third (36%) of the respondents worked at two of the system's Magnet designated hospitals. Magnet RNs reported more resources and held more positive beliefs about their hospital's organizational readiness for EBP. Nurses who possess advanced nursing degrees, certification, and who serve in leadership roles were favorable toward EBP. Younger RNs with fewer years in practice were more likely to have positive beliefs toward EBP and embedding it into the organizational culture. Linking Evidence to PracticeFindings mirror previous research where nurses internationally favor EBP yet struggle with similar barriers for implementation. Strategies to link this evidence to action can be taken at local and global levels. Locally, transformational nurse leaders within each hospital can share the vision for implementing EBP and embrace Magnet principles. At the system level, transformational nurse leaders can collectively allocate resources to create a system-wide online EBP education plan with EBP competencies and tool kit to increase RN exposure to EBP and standardize practice. Globally, promoting free and accessible EBP massive open online courses (MOOC) and sharing best practices online and at international forums such as Magnet conferences will help to lead, educate, and mentor nurses with strategies to systematically increase EBP uptake.",,WORLDVIEWS ON EVIDENCE-BASED NURSING,,WILEY,,,

With nearly 24,000 enrolled as of early 2015, it is the largest astronomy MOOC available. The astronomical numbers enrolled do not translate into a similar level of engagement. The content consists of 14 hours of video lecture, nearly 1,000 Powerpoint slides, 250 pages of background readings, and 20 podcast interviews with leading researchers. Perhaps in part because of the large amount of course content, the overall completion rate is low, about 3%. However, this number was four times higher for an early cohort of learners who were selected to have a prior interest in astronomy and who took the class in synchronous mode, with new content being added every week. Completion correlates with engagement as measured by posts to the online discussion board. For a subset of learners, social media like Facebook and Twitter provide an additional, important mode of engagement. For the asynchronous learners who have continuously enrolled for the past 15 months, those who complete the course do so quickly, with few persisting longer than two months. The availability of a free completion certificate had no impact on completion rates when it was added midway through the period of data analyzed in this paper. This experiment informs a new offering of an enhanced version of this MOOC via Coursera, along with a co-convened flipped introductory astronomy class at the University of Arizona, where the video lectures will be online and class time will be used exclusively for small group labs and hands-on activities.

Characterizing the different types of participation in MOOCs is fundamental in order to be able to better evaluate the phenomenon and to support MOOCs developers and instructors in devising courses which are adapted for different learners' needs. Thus, the purpose of this study was to characterize the different types of participant behavior in a MOOC. Using a data mining methodology, 21,889 participants of a MOOC were classified into clusters, based on their activity in the main learning resources of the course: video lectures, discussion forums, and assessments. Thereafter, the participants in each cluster were characterized in regard to demographics, course participation, and course achievement characteristics. Seven types of participant behavior were identified: Tasters (64.8%), Downloaders (8.5%), Disengagers (11.5%), Offline Engagers (3.6%), Online Engagers (7.4%), Moderately Social Engagers (3.7%), and Social Engagers (0.6%). A significant number of 1,020 participants were found to be engaged in the course, but did not achieve a certificate. The types are discussed according to the established research questions. The results provide further evidence regarding the utilization of the flexibility, which is offered in MOOCs, by the participants according to their needs.

This gap is growing wider every day and has created a current educational crisis about DNA, how life works and biotechnology. The largest challenges in biotechnology right now are not technological, but those of public perception as biotechnology education has not kept pace with the rapid growth of its science. A working knowledge of DNA, genetics and biotechnology has become as fundamental to a basic education as an understanding of the solar system. A highly successful General Education OnCampus course on biotechnology has been developed to meet this need for a general audience into an OnLine course which is now made further accessible as a MOOC. The material and format for this course on general biotechnology has created a versatile platform for teaching about the various topics in biotechnology today. This course is intended for the general public, life sciences industry science and non-science staff, high school teachers and undergraduate students regardless of their major or degree program. There are no prerequisites. An online series of lectures and the platform of educational materials has been created that allows for the presentation of independent modules on the various topics. This flexible platform also has been used to develop workshops for various industries and their science and non-science staff. The more our society understands the fundamentals about biotechnology, the better equipped they will be to participate affecting career opportunities, economic development, policy and decision making, as well as general consumer education in a lifelong learning process. All course lectures and materials can be viewed at www. lifeedu.us. This OnLine course and its MOOC aim to accomplish three goals: 1) to provide basic knowledge about DNA, genomics and biotechnology that is fundamental to the how biological life functions, 2) to provide a literate knowledge of the current applications in biotechnology, and career opportunities in the growing fields that are related to biotechnology; and 3) to learn about the issues and ethics concerning the future of biotechnology and our society. This general educational course is for all undergraduate, HS students, teachers and the general public globally through lifeedu. us.

In this paper, a review of the current published literature focusing on the use of MOOCs by instructors or students was conducted. Our primary goal in doing this is to summarize the accumulated state of knowledge concerning the main motivations and challenges of using MOOCs, as well as to identify issues that have yet to be fully addressed or resolved. Our findings suggest four reasons why students sign up for MOOCs: the desire to learn about a new topic or to extend current knowledge, they were curious about MOOCs, for personal challenge, and the desire to collect as many completion certificates as possible. Up to 90% drop out due to reasons including a lack of incentive, failure to understand the content material and having no one to turn to for help, and having other priorities to fulfill. Findings suggest three main reasons why instructors wish to teach MOOCs: being motivated by a sense of intrigue, the desire to gain some personal (egoistic) rewards, or a sense of altruism. Four key challenges of teaching MOOCs are also surfaced: difficulty in evaluating students' work, having a sense of speaking into a vacuum due to the absence of student immediate feedback, being burdened by the heavy demands of time and money, and encountering a lack of student participation in online forums. We conclude by discussing two issues that have yet to be fully resolved - the quality of MOOC education, and the assessment of student work.

Unfortunately, MOOCs can hardly be considered a success story when it comes to the completion rates, High dropout rates are an important argument to claim that MOOCs do not withstand the comparison with traditional university programs. However, learners who enroll in a MOOC do not necessarily want certification but might have various reasons for subscribing. In this study we use Self-regulation Learning (SRL) as an initial framework to examine the role of students' motivation in their perception of the success of MOOCs. The motivational concepts from SRL are mapped to an adaptation of technology acceptance models (e.g. UTAUT) and the Delone and McLean Information Success model, and validated with an international sample of MOOC learners. An empirical analysis reveals that most MOOC users are intrinsically goal oriented and not per se in search of certification or curriculum building. Intrinsic motivation and perceived enjoyment are, contrary to extrinsic motivation, the most important determinants of satisfaction and continuance intention. Such knowledge might have ramifications for the design of MOOCs and raise doubt as to whether MOOCs should be regarded as equivalents of conventional higher education courses.",,EDULEARN16: 8TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON EDUCATION AND NEW LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES,8th International Conference on Education and New Learning Technologies (EDULEARN),IATED-INT ASSOC TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION & DEVELOPMENT,,,

The first two MOOCs, Powerful Tools for Teaching and Learning: Digital Storytelling MOOC (DS MOOC) and Powerful Tools for Teaching and Learning: Web 2.0 Tools, have been developed and offered multiple times on the Coursera platform. This paper reports on the relationships between learners' patterns and motives of engagement and their prior subject knowledge with their course performance in the Digital Storytelling MOOC. Results from this study indicate that learners who demonstrated active engagement in the MOOC tended to outperform other learners who did not practice this trait. Learners whose motives for participation involved earning the Continuing Professional Development certificate, gaining skills, ideas and inspirations, and improving their professional practice outperformed the students who valued these traits less. Learners who possessed moderate level of content knowledge seemed to benefit most from the course. This paper contributes insight into aspects of students' behaviors that possibly contributed to their success in a MOOC and invites discussion on how to reinforce these traits. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

WebOfScience,Article,"Lee, Y",Effect of uninterrupted time-on-task on students' success in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs),2018,"This study investigated the relationship between uninterrupted time-on-task and academic success of students enrolled in a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC). The variables representing uninterrupted time-on-task, such as number and duration of uninterrupted consecutive learning activities, were mined from the log files capturing how 4286 students tried to learn Newtonian mechanics concepts in a MOOC. These variables were used as predictors in the logistic regression model estimating the likelihood of students getting a course certificate at the end of the semester. The analysis results indicate that the predictive power of the logistic regression model, which was assessed by Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC), depends on the value of off-task activity threshold time, and the likelihood of students getting a course certificate increases as students were doing more uninterrupted learning activities over a longer period of time. The findings from this study suggest that a simple count of learning activities, which has been used as a proxy for time-on-task in previous studies, may not accurately describe student learning in the computer-based learning environment because it does not reflect the quality, such as uninterrupted durations, of those learning activities.

Players, Auditors, and Spectators in a Geographical Analysis Course about Natural Risks",2020,"Research interest in massive online and open courses (MOOCs) is rapidly growing, questioning who enrolls, why and how to conceive engagement, and success rates. This study is focused on MOOC-takers behavior obtained from a seven-week MOOC experience on natural risks. Data scraping principles have been used to collect data. Demographics, success-dropout rates, engagement periods, achievement and scoring, and behavior were analyzed through descriptive statistics, non-parametric correlation analysis, and statistical hypothesis testing. The results show that students who start earlier and those who finish earlier the course obtain better grades in some of the modules (motivation and background on natural risks could be the explanation). However, for 'last moment students', speed in passing the modules is either related to greater motivation, although in this case it is not related to better grades. Furthermore, students who complete tasks during the weekend take less time to complete the modules and obtain a better grade. In addition, a learning strategy is promoted by reconsidering who is learning:players(those who complete the course and earning a certificate),auditors(those who have completed a thematic unit or the whole module, earning partial knowledge), andspectators(those enrolled until the end of the course, who intend earning experience in e-learning).",,SUSTAINABILITY,,MDPI,,,

They offer low-cost education for both students and content providers; however, currently there is a very low level of course purchasing (less than 1% of the total number of enrolled students on a given online course opt to purchase its certificate). The most recent literature on MOOCs focuses on identifying factors that contribute to student success, completion level and engagement. One of the MOOC platforms' ultimate targets is to become self-sustaining, enabling partners to create revenues and offset operating costs. Nevertheless, analysing learners' purchasing behaviour on MOOCs remains limited. Thus, this study aims to predict students purchasing behaviour and therefore a MOOCs revenue, based on the rich array of activity clickstream and demographic data from learners. Specifically, we compare how several machine learning algorithms, namely RandomForest, GradientBoosting. AdaBoost and XGBoost can predict course purchasability using a large-scale data collection of 23 runs spread over 5 courses delivered by The University of Warwick between 2013 and 2017 via FutureLearn. We further identify the common representative predictive attributes that influence a learner's certificate purchasing decisions. Our proposed model achieved promising accuracies, between 0.82 and 0.91, using only the time spent on each step. We further reached higher accuracy of 0.83 to 0.95, adding learner demographics (e.g. gender, age group, level of education, and country) which showed a considerable impact on the model's performance. The outcomes of this study are expected to help design future courses and predict the profitability of future runs; it may also help determine what personalisation features could be provided to increase MOOC revenue.",,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN EDUCATION,,SPRINGER,,,

That is the use of computers to learn and teach. The term computer refers to internet, common and specialized software and mostly new ways to communicate and to have flexible access to any information. The paper is focusing on two main topics. First, three completed experiments of MOOCs in science and in human science have been supervised by the first three authors. Second, the general content and containers of MOOCs are here presented involving the French case on digital university on what the last author is working as an expert. The two first experiments on MOOCs are based on robotics and computer science. They are concerned with a group of twelve bachelor of technology students in electrical engineering. The MOOCs certificate takes a part of the final assessment. The third MOOC offers lessons on the leadership behaviour. A group of twelve students in bachelor of technology in Environmental Engineering domain have taken part to a leadership and management course. This course included straight at the starts, a participation to a MOOC. In all three presented examples, the teachers were always helping students. Weekly meetings and briefing planned in the agenda make the students more confident to themselves, give the teacher the opportunity to focus on any growing up difficulty and improve students behaviour to share knowledge. The feedback of the use of MOOCs is launching new questions about the impact of learning, teaching and evaluating online. The MOOCs interest is getting up due to the free, easy and available access to numerous domains covering sciences, philosophy, literature, management. MOOCs could be an answer for the knowledge worldwide sharing. The MOOCs providers are mainly coming from USA, UK, Germany, Spain and France. That implies a large amount of universities worldwide are collaborating with the providers. In France, the digital University platform has been launched at the end of 2013. Courses are available since 2014. They cover domains as Mathematics, Philosophy, History, Public Health. Within two years, one million of attendees took part to these online courses. The last author of this article offers his experience as an expert in digital University.

WebOfScience,Article,"Kumar, K",A study of Veterinary Scholars' Perception of MOOCs,2019,"Purpose Massive open online courses (MOOCs) are a currently trending e-learning platform that presumably attract thousands of participants because of boundless participation, are open to any person to enroll, are free to begin and are delivered completely online, thus contradicting the spatial limitations of a traditional classroom. This study aims to present the findings of a study among veterinary science students examining their perceptions of MOOCs. In total, 200 participants were randomly selected for the survey, out of which 177 responded, owing to a response rate of 88.7 per cent. Majority of the respondents (93 per cent) opined MOOCs supplement other learning methods and provide lifelong opportunity. A study report established that Coursera is the largest platform by user base (82 per cent), followed by Udemy (70 per cent), and 65 per cent knowledge seekers ranted the enormous propaganda about MOOCs are not because of the technology's inherent edifying value, but because of the incredible potentials of lower costs. The participants in this survey valued their course and overall MOOC experience pleasing. Design/methodology/approach The aim of the study is to explore veterinary students' perception of MOOCs featuring in their subject of interest. The questionnaire was written in English because it is the teaching language for undergraduates and postgraduates in most Indian higher education institutes, including the one used as a context for this study. The online questionnaires were electronically mailed to a sample of veterinary students (undergraduate and postgraduate) with a consent form seeking their permission for participation in this study and swearing them the confidentiality of their responses. The e-mail included information about the purpose of the study as well as the URL to the survey site, demographic questions on age, gender and education. This part was followed by an important research question asking if the student had heard about the new open online educational system (MOOCs) provided in websites, including Coursera, Edx, Udacity and FutureLearn, among others. Based on respondents' answers, they were directed to different sections. Students who knew about MOOCs were asked various mode of getting enrolled in MOOCs. If they were not enrolled in any course, the respondents were asked about the limitations to their use. Enrolled students were questioned on their perspectives and experiences with MOOCs. For students who gained certificates, were enquired for their level of satisfaction, opinions about the integration of MOOCs into the veterinary field and hindrances encountered during accessing the course. Out of a total of 200 students who initially agreed to take part, 177 responses were received, with a response rate of 88.50 per cent, with no cases of missing data. The data were stored automatically in the hosted online survey service into a separate database after the submission of the responses. The descriptive data analyses (such as average) were led using the data analysis tool provided. Findings Even though most MOOCs do not provide academic credit or result in a degree, some of the biggest beneficiaries of MOOCs are students formally enrolled in an academic program, are provided a free mode to obtain additional academic assistance that would not otherwise be available (Parke Muth, 2018)15. Correspondingly, 93 per cent of the students opined MOOCs supplement other learning methods and provide lifelong opportunity. Learning has traditionally cost both money and time. With MOOCs, it now just costs time. In total, 24 per cent of the participants have discoursed free of cost as one of the intentions to choose their course. Almost every respondent (99 per cent) was interested toward online discussion forum, and 91 per cent preferred course materials containing video and audio files were pretty beneficial, while 88 per cent felt teaching through electronic whiteboard was the most advantageous criterion in their course. The study findings indicated that Coursera is the largest platform by user base (82 per cent), followed by Udemy (70 per cent). Originality/value Animal health involves household pets and their care, in addition to livestock health and protection from diseases like bovine babesiosis, bovine tuberculosis and heartwater. There are numerous MOOCs offering online, contact or blended interventions in veterinary science and animal health that afford professionals quick and easy options to obtain credentials, including courses in pharmacology and toxicology, practice management, veterinary and para-veterinary studies, veterinary tropical diseases, radiology and wildlife management. As it is necessary to gain an understanding of the veterinary students' level of familiarity and their insight toward the MOOC concept, the study attempts to explore their knowledge through an online survey.",,INFORMATION AND LEARNING SCIENCES,,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,,,

As a form of largely free and self-paced education, MOOCs are less formal than credit-bearing university courses. It is often the case that MOOCs do not count toward a formal university qualification, and that majority learners enter MOOCs for various purposes other than specifically gaining a certificate. As a result, assessment and critical thinking, valued by universities as important learning outcomes are thought to be less relevant to MOOCs learners or designers. In the last couple of years, however, a few universities have started to design credit-bearing MOOCs as part of university programs. The aim is to encourage quality learning and outcomes that satisfy formal university assessment criteria. MOOCs designed to target particular groups of professionals for career advancement are also emerging. Both trends require a rethink of the relevance of assessment and critical thinking in MOOCs. This paper provides a case study of a MOOC targeted at health professionals, which demonstrates how self-and peer-assessment are designed to encourage critical thinking, and includes a discussion on future directions and constraints of this work-in-progress. The paper proposes that critical thinking is relevant for learning in MOOCs and that carefully designed assessment tasks are essential for developing MOOCs' learners' critical thinking.",,DIGITAL EDUCATION: OUT TO THE WORLD AND BACK TO THE CAMPUS,5th European MOOCs Stakeholders Summit (EMOOCs),SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,,,

Although this phenomenon is new, the literature on e-assessment suggests a direction based on a knowledge base derived from research into the support needs of the participants' learning. Together with assessment, participant satisfaction with MOOCs takes on a special role when we consider the interest of the courses and their high drop-out rate. We have two objectives in this paper; on one hand, we analyze the assessment processes in 87 MOOCs developed on different international platforms (Coursera, Udacity, MiriadaX, EdX, and RedunX) at Spanish universities (AbiertaUGR, UPVX, UniMOOC, UnedComa, and Ehusfera) and others; while on the other hand, we reflect on these processes assisted by the study of the MOOCs developed at the University of Granada (Spain). We describe the results classified according to: what is assessed, who performs the assessment, time at which assessment occurs, instruments employed, type of assessment, and type of the certification (participation/accreditation). We study the satisfaction of 513 participants in courses of the first edition offered by AbiertaUGR in 2013. Participant satisfaction is related to interactivity, and the learning perceived corresponds to a formative assessment or assessment for learning.

Recently, edX introduced the concept of a MicroMasters program, a series of courses on graduate level that upon successful completion both lead to an own-standing professional certificate and also offer a pathway to credit in a regular master program of the MOOC-hosting university. This paper reports on first experiences of setting up a MicroMasters program Emerging Automotive Technologies developed by Chalmers University of Technology. The study uses data from (1) pre- and post- course surveys, (2) activity analytics, (3) performance measures and experiential data from the course developers of the first MOOC in the program. The results show that the additional conditions and stakeholders add new and sometimes conflicting objectives to the MOOC development process that cannot be easily aligned. Nevertheless, the first MOOC of the program is considered a successful start. Compared to traditional MOOCs, the study indicates that there is little difference between the learner populations. On the other hand, the levels of activity were significantly higher throughout the course. The paper concludes that the concept of the MicroMasters program is a mixed blessing with new layers of complexity in the MOOC development process. If managed successfully - the MicroMasters concept can lead to higher quality of the MOOC as well as higher motivation and better learning experiences among the MOOC participants.",,EDULEARN18: 10TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON EDUCATION AND NEW LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES,10th International Conference on Education and New Learning Technologies (EDULEARN),IATED-INT ASSOC TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION & DEVELOPMENT,,,
WebOfScience,Proceedings Paper,"Henno, J; Jaakkola, H; Makela, J",From Learning to E-learning to M-learning to C-learning to ... ?,2014,"Need for Higher Education is growing rapidly - by 2020 two thirds of all jobs will require postsecondary education [1]. The current higher education system cannot satisfy this need in many fields, e.g. Gartner predicts, that already in 2015 only a third of jobs for big data analysts can be filled [2]. The rapid development of Information and Communication Technology (ITC, IT) has changed many aspects of teaching and learning. Educational materials are moving into cloud(s) and degrees are given on-line ('Master's Degree Online Directory' lists over 90,000 programs [3]), old-fashioned Colleges and Universities with large campus, staff and high costs are getting more and more competition from numerous educational entrepreneurs, who start massive open online courses (MOOC) with millions of users/students from all around the world; they establish new on-line universities where costs of obtaining a degree are marginal compared to 'brick-and-mortal' universities and which are open to nearly everyone independent of user geographical location. Until now MOOC have not yet proved their value - less than 4% of enrollees complete the courses [4] and they do not receive (yet) university diploma. But the World most prestigious technical university, MIT, has already set up a certification system - students who can master the subjects taught in MOOC receive an official certificate of completion [5]. Although these certificates will not carry the weight of a traditional MIT diploma (they will be issued by started by MIT online learning initiative called MITx), but the word 'MIT' alone carries a weight. When speaking about possibilities of IT in education most speakers/writers are excitedly discussing technology - servers, communication lines, bandwidth, security (preferably all in thick cloud of technical jargon). Nearly nobody presents practical experience, suggestions and/or theories about how to teach with this new technology in order best to utilize its possibilities. The 'education in the cloud' mainly consists of video clips trying to repeat the classroom experience: recorded before the old-fashioned blackboard (only nowadays it is white), where professor is presenting the same lecture what he presented in lecture hall, only now lectures are cut into 5-10 min video clips - the 'mobile approach'. Is this why the old lecture halls are still needed? Rapidly increasing costs of University Education, increasing competition of educational entrepreneurs and constant increase of population of working students have made clear, that both sides of University education - teaching/learning and accrediting, giving diplomas need changes. University Education should more take into account students informal and non-formal learning, their participation in professional work - both in organization of study and in certification.

In the last decades, multiple new digital platforms have appeared in the learning arena, including massive open online courses and social-media-based education. The major critique of these novel methods is the lack of the ability to ascertain the origin, validity, and accountability of the knowledge that is created, shared, and acquired. Recently, a novel technology based on secured data storage and transmission, called blockchain, has emerged as a way to generate networks where validity, trust, and accountability can be created. Conceptually, blockchain is an open, public, distributed, and secure digital registry where information transactions are secured and have a clear origin, explicit pathways, and concrete value. Health professions education based on blockchain will potentially allow improved tracking of content and the individuals who create it, quantify educational impact on multiple generations of learners, and build a relative value of educational interventions. Furthermore, institutions adopting blockchain technology would be able to provide certification and credentialing of health care professionals with no intermediaries. There is potential for blockchain to significantly change the future of health professions education and radically transform how patients, professionals, educators, and learners interact around safe, valid, and accountable information.",,ACADEMIC MEDICINE,,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,,,
WebOfScience,Proceedings Paper,"Chin, P",THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF MASSIVE OPEN ONLINE COURSES ON TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION AND GLOBALIZATION,2019,"For decades it has been identified by practitioners, educators and governments that there is a significant digital divide because of a lack of easy and ready access to the internet across countries. Over the years, this disparity has decreased somewhat because of open markets and global competition and the infiltration of telecommunication companies into some of these countries. These telecommunication companies provide the infrastructure and services needed to get access to the internet. This improvement addresses one aspect however, another area of disparity that is often highlighted is the availability and access to technology education and the development of the skill sets needed to succeed in this area. Globally we have seen the use of technology grow exponentially in every area of life from communications to production and supply chain management to the financial sector and the economy. It would therefore seem that it is in the best interest of any country to have its people embrace technology and acquire the skills needed to utilize technology effectively. For some countries however the economic cost of this type of education for all its citizens is a deterrent. Technology education and training can be obtained utilizing a variety of different methodologies both formal and informal, such as degrees, certifications, skill-based courses, self-taught tools and techniques. The internet has also had a significant impact on course availability, delivery and the way individuals learn. One such area that has evolved with over a dozen different platforms is in eLearning using Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC). A MOOC is a course of study in a specific area that is available online to anyone who wishes to utilize it. Most MOOCs are free, although some do have a fee which is charged for value-added services. Several universities and colleges in the United States and other countries globally have created MOOCs which are available for anyone to use. In 2016 it was reported that there were over 6000+ MOOC courses with over 58 million students enrolled. The research question being explored here focuses on the potential impact that this may have on bridging the gap in the area of technology education and the potential for a globalized educational platform. Do MOOCs have the potential of levelling the playing field as it relates to the availability of skills-based training in technology and other fields of study.",,EDULEARN19: 11TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON EDUCATION AND NEW LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES,11th International Conference on Education and New Learning Technologies (EDULEARN),IATED-INT ASSOC TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION & DEVELOPMENT,,,

To advance our understanding of how people learn in MOOCs, we investigate the intersection between learning design and the temporal process of engagement in the course. This study investigates the detailed processes of engagement using educational process mining in a FutureLearn science course (N = 2086 learners) and applying an established taxonomy of learning design to classify learning activities. The analyses were performed on three groups of learners categorised based upon their clicking behaviour. The process-mining results show at least one dominant pathway in each of the three groups, though multiple popular additional pathways were identified within each group. All three groups remained interested and engaged in the various learning and assessment activities. The findings from this study suggest that in the analysis of voluminous MOOC data there is value in first clustering learners and then investigating detailed progressions within each cluster that take the order and type of learning activities into account. The approach is promising because it provides insight into variation in behavioural sequences based on learners' intentions for earning a course certificate. These insights can inform the targeting of analytics-based interventions to support learners and inform MOOC designers about adapting learning activities to different groups of learners based on their goals.",,JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN HIGHER EDUCATION,,SPRINGER,,,

MOOCs are a new way to design and deliver online learning. Learners become part of an on-line community where they can participate as reviewers, collaborate with each other and are engaged in watching videos and other multimedia resources. However, MOOCs are also generating a huge debate around three different aspects: the learning process including evaluation and certification criteria, the lack of skills among instructors to design and plan MOOCs and the technical and security issues of MOOC platforms. More specifically, institutions are currently making a great effort to become part of main facilitators' platforms. They are creating a good number of methodologies, guidelines and best practices to equip instructors with the necessary skills to produce high-quality learning resources that can encourage learners' participation and decrease the dropout rate. On the other hand, engineering education is one of the main areas of interest in MOOC courses. In the software and computer engineering area it is possible to find a huge number of MOOCs in particular topics ranging from an introductory to a master level. However, just a few courses address a holistic view of a domain such as software engineering due to the intrinsic difficulty of summarizing in a few weeks the main concepts of an engineering discipline. That is why, in this paper, authors introduce an Agile MOOC Development Lifecycle (AMDL) to address the challenge of designing a MOOC from scratch. Afterwards, the framework is applied to create a MOOC course about software engineering for a non-technical audience and developed by a large and multidisciplinary team of 18 instructors. This experience is also reported as a case study to validate the proposed development lifecycle.

The digital competence, not yet typically incorporated into the curricula in Spain and key competence for lifelong learning as for the EU Recommendation 2006/962/EC, can be especially upgraded. This paper presents the structure of the new course as implemented in the Master's Programme in Energy Efficiency in Building, Industrial and Transportation Engineering at Universidad Politecnica de Madrid (MUEE-UPM) in the academic year 2017-2018. As part of this master, this 15 ECTS course is offered as elective, and was also conceived to train students to face the preparation of the master's thesis, for who the tools, information sources and connections that a properly designed PLE entails can be highly beneficial. This paper aims to contribute to the growing, but yet limited, literature on the PLEs' implementation in higher education. The replicable structure of the course is shown (validated for 15 ECTS and adaptable to other volumes of learning), designed to be offered as blended learning. The lectures and tutorials combine the flipped classroom method with the follow-up of massive open online courses (MOOCs) on transversal competencies (e.g. communication, leadership) and specific skills on energy efficiency (e.g. energy performance certificates, sustainable energy) due to the character of the ongoing pilot experience in the framework of the MUEE-UPM.",,"12TH INTERNATIONAL TECHNOLOGY, EDUCATION AND DEVELOPMENT CONFERENCE (INTED)","12th International Technology, Education and Development Conference (INTED)",IATED-INT ASSOC TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION & DEVELOPMENT,,,

Massive open online course (MOOC) platforms such as Coursera, edX, and Udemy have made available several thousands of short courses at several difficulty levels in a wide variety of disciplines, ranging from business, computer science to literature, for learners to select from. Learners who are looking to earn credentials for career advancement or personal interest would find MOOCs attractive not only because of the time and place flexibility these courses offer, but also because of the free enrollment or the very small certificate fee upon completion, as well as the emergent recognition these courses are receiving for their high quality learning delivery from leading educational institutions. Learners who enroll in a MOOC would typically need to participate in various learning activities and complete a few assessment tasks to complete the course. However, it has been commonly reported that the completion rates of MOOCs are low. Based on the common notion that when learners are more motivated to learn, they are likely to better engage in learning and have a higher likelihood to complete a MOOC, this study adopted the Motivation and Engagement Scale (MES) by Martin (2007, 2009) to collect responses from university students to examine whether positive motivation resulted in positive engagement; whether negative motivation resulted in negative engagement; and how positive or negative engagement swayed learners' inclination to complete a MOOC if they were to enroll in one. Findings show that there was a statistically significant positive relationship between positive motivation and positive engagement, between negative motivation and negative engagement, and between positive engagement and inclination to complete a MOOC. However, the relationship between negative engagement and inclination to complete a MOOC was statistically not significant. Findings of this study can be useful to MOOC providers and learners in their effort to develop strategies to increase completion rates of MOOCs.",,ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF E-LEARNING,,ACAD CONFERENCES & PUBL INT LTD,,,
WebOfScience,Review,"Ramirez, MV",Training future anesthesiologists in obstetric care,2017,"Purpose of review In order for the obstetric anesthesiologist to become a true perioperative / peripartum physician, a change in formative programs and certification process in anesthesia are needed. Recent findings Anesthesia training programs are migrating to competency based medical education (CBME) worldwide. The traditional model of attending lectures, grand rounds, reading textbooks and journal papers should be complemented by virtual modalities such as massive open online courses or online teaching tools. The gold standard for assessment of procedural skills in anesthesia consists of a combination of global rating scales and previously validated checklists. Behaviors in the perioperative environment not directly related to the use of drugs, equipment or medical expertise are known as anesthesiologist nontechnical skills and trainees must learn and practice these skills; nontechnical skills can determine 50-80% of adverse events in high-risk professions, including medicine. Regular certification programs are also an important component of the new approach in medical education, in some high-income countries, the specialist anesthesiologist is undertaking regular certification but the impact of these programs on overall outcomes is still unknown. Summary The obstetric population is becoming a higher risk population, requiring an obstetric anesthesiologist taking on the role of a perioperative / peripartum physician. It is essential that anesthesia training programs migrate to CBME through simulation-based curriculum that allow the achievement of nontechnical skills and team work competencies.

THE MU.SA - MUSEUM SECTOR ALLIANCE PROJECT,2019,"This paper aims to present the Mu.SA - Museum Sector Alliance project, funded by the European Commission, more specifically by the Erasmus+ Program and the Key Action 2 (Cooperation for Innovation and Good Practice Exchange), which supports the Sector Competences Alliances (575907-EPP-1-2016- 1-EL-EPPKA2-SSA). Building on the results of a previous project (eCult Skills_2013-15), funded by the Lifelong Learning Program, weaknesses in the museum sector were identified at the level of digital and transversal competences. The Mu.SA project intended to contribute to the mitigation of these fragilities, in order to empower museum professionals, as well as those who aspire to be, to better face the challenges of Information and Communication Technologies and to enhance their museums and Society by promoting their development and sustainability, building on larger and stronger synergies between different sectors of education, training and youth, for the better articulated interaction between research, policies and practices and for the best use of references for recognition and validation of competences and qualifications. Thus, based on the identification and characterization of a set of emerging professional profiles and respective competences, the Mu.SA - Museum Sector Alliance aimed at, and has been, developing an Open Educational Resources repository to support individual equipping in more than forty digital and transversal competences. These duly structured resources are offered in different formats of education and training courses: a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC), certified and of a generic and introductory nature; and a Specialization Course, credited and structured considering e-learning, face-to-face and work-based learning contexts. The legitimate and reasoned expectation of building communities of practice will also contribute to ensuring the sustainability of the results, beyond the duration of the project. Among the other positive expected results, at the level of those more or less directly involved in its activities, there may be an increase in the spirit of initiative and entrepreneurship, a more active participation in Society, a greater capacity for understanding, respect and response.",,"12TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF EDUCATION, RESEARCH AND INNOVATION (ICERI2019)","12th Annual International Conference of Education, Research and Innovation (ICERI)",IATED-INT ASSOC TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION & DEVELOPMENT,,,

Methods A 5-week MOOC on behavioral medicine was hosted on the edX platform. The authors developed two branched virtual patients consisting of video recordings of a live standardized patient, with multiple clinical decision points and narration unfolding depending on learners' choices. Students interacted with the virtual patients to treat stress and sleep problems. Answers to the exit survey and participant comments from the discussion forum were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. Results In total, 19,236 participants enrolled in the MOOC, out of which 740 received the final certificate. The virtual patients were completed by 2317 and 1640 participants respectively. Among survey respondents (n = 442), 83.1% agreed that the virtual patient exercise was helpful. The qualitative analysis resulted in themes covering what it was like to work with the virtual patient, with subthemes on learner-centered education, emotions/eustress, game comparisons, what the participants learned, what surprised them, how confident participants felt about applying interventions in practice, suggestions for improvement, and previous experiences of virtual patients. Conclusions Students were enthusiastic about interacting with the virtual patients as a means to apply new knowledge about behavioral medicine interventions. The most common suggestion was to incorporate more interactive cases with various levels of complexity. Further research should include patient outcomes and focus on interprofessional aspects of learning with virtual patients in a MOOC.",,ACADEMIC PSYCHIATRY,,SPRINGER,,,
WebOfScience,Article; Early Access,"Goli, A; Chintagunta, PK; Sriram, S",Effects of Payment on User Engagement in Online Courses,,"Massive open online courses (MOOCs) have the potential to democratize education by improving access. Although retention and completion rates for nonpaying users have not been promising, these statistics are much brighter for users who pay to receive a certificate upon completing the course. We investigate whether paying for the certificate option can increase engagement with course content. In particular, we consider two effects: (1) the certificate effect, which is the boost in motivation to stay engaged to receive the certificate; and (2) the sunk-cost effect, which arises solely because the user paid for the course. We use data from over 70 courses offered on the Coursera platform and study the engagement of individual participants at different milestones within each course. The panel nature of the data enables us to include controls for intrinsic differences between nonpaying and paying users in terms of their desire to stay engaged. We find evidence that the certificate and sunk-cost effects increase user engagement by approximately 8%-9% and 17%-20%, respectively. Whereas the sunk-cost effect is transient and lasts for only a few weeks after payment, the certificate effect lasts until the participant reaches the grade required to be eligible to receive the certificate. We discuss the implications of our findings for how platforms and content creators may design course milestones and schedule payment of course fees. Given that greater engagement tends to improve learning outcomes, our study serves as an important first step in understanding the role of prices and payment in enabling MOOCs to realize their full potential.",,JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH,,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,,,

This paper aims to give tutors a clearer vision for an effective and personalized intervention as a solution to retain each type of learner at risk of dropping out. Design/methodology/approach This paper presents a methodology to provide predictions on learners' behaviors. This work, which uses a Stanford data set, was divided into several phases, namely, a data extraction, an exploratory study and then a multivariate analysis to reduce dimensionality and to extract the most relevant features. The second step was the comparison between five machine learning algorithms. Finally, the authors used the principle of association rules to extract similarities between the behaviors of learners who dropped out from the MOOC. Findings The results of this work have given that deep learning ensures the best predictions in terms of accuracy, which is an average of 95.8 per cent, and is comparable to other measures such as precision, AUC, Recall and F1 score. Originality/value Many research studies have tried to tackle the MOOC dropout problem by proposing different dropout predictive models. In the same context, comes the present proposal with which the authors have tried to predict not only learners at a risk of dropping out of the MOOCs but also those who will succeed or fail.",,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WEB INFORMATION SYSTEMS,,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,,,

The research was conducted in a cohort-based astronomy MOOC Astronomy: Exploring Time and Space provided through the Coursera platform. In order to discern motivations of course participants, the Science Motivation Questionnaire II was administered as a first assignment of the course. The survey data were collected from December 2016 until December 2018 and responses from 3701 learners were acquired. In order to determine the relationship of motivation to course performance, four course engagement indicators are defined: course completion, use of video lectures, participation in the discussion forums, and participation in peer-grading assignments. Self-determination and self-efficacy are identified as the main motivational factors influencing all aspects of the course engagement except for the video usage. We show that both of these decrease with age, but increase with the number of previously taken science courses. The main reasons for signing up for the course which had an effect on course engagement were the goal of getting a certificate and perceived importance of the reputation of the instructor. There was no statistically significant difference in motivations between people who dropped after the first peer graded writing assignment and those who successfully completed the course, suggesting that after the first writing assignment learners quit from other reasons than lack of motivation. Unexpectedly, learners with high career, grade, and social motivation watched statistically significantly fewer instructional videos, and social motivation did not play a role in the forum usage.",,PHYSICAL REVIEW PHYSICS EDUCATION RESEARCH,,AMER PHYSICAL SOC,,,

Despite these factors, the flexible learning offered by a MOOC has the potential to provide an accessible educational environment for a broad spectrum of participants. In this regard, the Wicking Dementia Research and Education Centre has developed a MOOC on dementia that is evidence-based and intended to address this emerging major global public health issue by providing educational resources to a broad range of caregivers, people with dementia, and health care professionals. Methods: The Understanding Dementia MOOC was designed specifically to appeal to, and support, adult learners with a limited educational background. The nine-week course was presented in three units. Participants passed a quiz at the end of each unit to continue through the course. A series of discussion boards facilitated peer-to-peer interactions. A separate Ask an Expert discussion board also was established for each unit where participants posted questions and faculty with expertise in the area responded. Results: Almost 10,000 people from 65 countries registered; 4,409 registrants engaged in the discussion boards, and 3,624 (38%) completed the course. Participants' level of education ranged from postgraduate study to a primary (elementary) school education. Participants without a university education (vocational certificate and below) were as likely as those with a university education to complete the course (X-2 = 2.35, df = 6, p = 0.88) and to engage in the online discussions (F[6, 3799] = 0.85, p = 0.54). Further, participants who completed the MOOC engaged in significantly more discussion board posts than participants who did not complete the course (t = 39.60, df = 4407, p <0.001). Conclusions: The high completion rate and level of engagement of participants across a broad spectrum of levels of education suggest that MOOCs can be successfully developed and delivered to students from diverse educational backgrounds. The high participation rate also highlights the combination of MOOC design as well as the scale of unmet need for quality dementia education.",,BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION,,BMC,,,

Through interrogating Coursera data and pre-/post-course student experience surveys, we investigated student retention, student experience, changes in attitudes, and changes in knowledge. The course ran for 5 weeks, and 33,501 students signed up, of which 16.4% (n = 5,501) received a Certificate of Achievement, indicating they had completed all assessments within the course. This retention rate is above the industry standard of 10%; however, the value of retention rate as a metric to judge MOOC success is questionable. Instead, we focus on demographics, with Coursera data estimating that 41% of learners came from Europe, 35% from North America, 11% from Asia, 6% from Oceania, 5% from South America, and 2% from Africa. Most learners had completed an undergraduate degree. Despite this wide range of backgrounds, 57.2% of post-course respondents (n = 2,399) strongly agreed that the information presented was at the right level and 64.9% strongly agreed that the course was interesting.

A case study,2020,"Evaluation in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC) is currently a central element of debate and one of the aspects of greatest concern when planning the pedagogical design of this kind or courses. The purpose of the article is twofold. On the one hand, to describe the evaluation system implemented during three editions in the MOOC Digital Literacy for groups at risk of social exclusion: Strategies for Socio-educational Intervention. (European Project ECO). On the other hand, we analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the assessment system described. We have designed the evaluative model as a central and dynamic part of pedagogical design, allowing us to know our virtual participants (initial evaluation), to tutor their work and to evaluate their results (assesment of learning processes) and, finally, to obtain information in order to take decisions for improvement in each new edition (evaluation oriented to improvement). First of all, we describe the evaluation model. Then we analyze the main data collected with the tools used (initial questionnaire, interactions in Facebook groups and other social spaces, self-evaluation questionnaires, peer to peer evaluation, key informants and platform data). Finally, we discuss the results obtained in order to provide reflections that can guide the design of evaluation processes in MOOC. The main thesis we defend is that the planning of the evaluative model is a central element that must be outlined from minute one and be fully integrated with the rest of elements of the pedagogical design. Evaluative model should contemplate strategies for the initial and formative assessment of the participants and of the teaching-learning process itself, and not only be based on the final assessment oriented towards certification.",,PROFESORADO-REVISTA DE CURRICULUM Y FORMACION DE PROFESORADO,,"UNIV GRANADA, GRUPO INVESTIGACION FORCE",,,

Design/methodology/approach A qualitative-quantitative study of correlational and descriptive scope is carried out on two instruments based on pre- and post-tests of 6,029 participants, which is followed by a qualitative data analysis distributed by code families to identify participants' main motivations to take MOOCs. Findings The results showed a positive moderate-high correlation between expectancy-value and achievement goals, which means in a practical sense that the participants' subjective estimates of the possibility of reaching their goals prior to the beginning of the course were fulfilled, as the intentionality of the subjects-participants was positive with respect to the contents imparted. Practical implications The profiles of participants with a higher tendency to successfully finish the course and with high rates of engagement share the following characteristics: having previously and successfully finished more than one MOOC; taking the MOOC for work purposes (promotion, seeking better job opportunities, etc.); and having intrinsic motivation, that is, not depending on external factors such as obligations and certifications. Originality/value This research suggests that there are pre-educational factors that define the trend of successful completion of MOOCs, based on expectancy-value (e.g. previous experiences with other MOOCs) and achievement goals (e.g. job improvement), with external motivational issues such as completion certificates being less prevalent in the learning intention.",,INTERACTIVE TECHNOLOGY AND SMART EDUCATION,,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,,,

Visual materials such as videos and discussion forums are basic ways of engaging students in MOOCs. Student achievement in MOOCs is typically measured using assessments distributed throughout the course. Although there is research on the basic forms of student's engagement and assessment in MOOCs, little is known about their effect on students' achievement in the form of students completing a MOOC. Using binomial logistic regression models, this paper addresses this gap in the literature by presenting the degree to which student engagement with videos and forum posts can predict students' probability of achievement in a MOOC. It also explores the extent to which participation behaviors and their intention to receive the course certification can be used to predict achievement in MOOCs. Using qualitative content analysis, this paper discusses the quality of the forum posts exchanged by participants in this MOOC. The findings from quantitative analysis support MOOC's pedagogical assumptions, showing that students' engagement in forums and with videos increases the probability of course achievement. It also shows that intention to certify plays a moderator effect on the number of videos watched, enhancing achievement in MOOCs. The findings from qualitative analysis reveal that most students' posts in forums display more information acquisition than critical thinking. Implications for practice suggest MOOC designers and MOOC instructors foster engagement in forums by implementing discussion prompts that foster interactions about deep meaning of concepts or application of concepts covered in the MOOC. In regard to videos, implications for practice suggest the creation of interactive videos that promote students' engagement and control such as inserting guiding questions and segmenting the video content. Future research comprising multiple MOOC cohorts is suggested to validate the empirical model presented in this study.",,ONLINE LEARNING,,ONLINE LEARNING CONSORTIUM,,,

All of them make up the profiles of the participants, whose lack of knowledge constitutes an important barrier in order to identify and get a better understanding of their underlying relationships. This paper, whose scope is the data collection of MOOCKnowledge project, aims to identify and analyze the types of profiles of participants with previous experience in MOOC format according to their degree of prior satisfaction by running clustering techniques. These approaches fit the final purpose of finding groups of satisfaction (groups of participants) according to the similarity of the selected items for measuring their degree of satisfaction. The elements through which is built up the participant's degree of prior satisfaction are, among others, course materials, video lectures, teacher(s), learning activities, assignments, feedback given, pace of the course, language used, MOOC difficulty, technical requirements and certification options. The approach of this paper is focused on the similarities within the identified groups of satisfaction (types of profiles of participants' MOOC) as result of clustering process. The identification and further analysis of the hidden relationships in the internal structure of elements on each group might help stakeholders to identify the most relevant ones that impact in a decisive way on participant's previous satisfaction regarding MOOC format. It should be highlighted that this study, fed with a dataset that comes from MOOCKnowledge data collection, might help in setting up short and medium term strategies aimed not only to discover an individualized knowledge regarding the more influential elements for the groups of satisfaction, but also to analyze the changes in the degree of satisfaction of participants after the completion of the course.",,"ICERI2016: 9TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF EDUCATION, RESEARCH AND INNOVATION","9th Annual International Conference of Education, Research and Innovation (iCERi)",IATED-INT ASSOC TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION A& DEVELOPMENT,,,

Design/methodology/approach The primary data were collected from the field surveys conducted in the universities and academic institutions located in National Capital Region of Delhi, India, using convenience sampling technique. Structural equation modelling was used to test the hypothesized relationships in the proposed model. Findings The findings indicate that the learners' intention to adopt MOOCs is significantly influenced by intrinsic motivation, social recognition, perceived value and perceived usefulness. On the other hand, the personal readiness, self-regulation of learners and peer influence are not found to have any significant impact on MOOCs adoption intention. Practical implications The findings of the study will be helpful for MOOCs providers and other stakeholders. The MOOCs providers should emphasize on providing courses from renowned universities in cutting-edge areas which are self-paced and cost-effective. The academic institutions should provide credit benefits to the students in lieu of completing courses through MOOCs. Likewise, employers should also recognize the certificates awarded by MOOCs and give due credit to the learners who complete such certifications. Originality/value The study has contributed to the existing literature on MOOCs adoption by combining constructs from TUE and SDT.

MOOCs are considered a means for democratizing education. These courses will hopefully provide an opportunity for individuals to learn from the best educators in the world, as well as help expand their personal networks, and facilitate their career development. However, research thus far shows that the majority of people taking advantage of these courses are already employed, have post-secondary degrees, and have encountered few barriers related to the affordability of higher education. Little is known about MOOC learners with financial constraints and who do not fit the typical profile of MOOC learners. This paper presents the results of the analysis of data from six Coursera courses offered by the University of Michigan from fall 2012 through winter 2013. In this analysis learners who self-identified as being unable to afford to pursue a formal education (the target group) were contrasted to other learners (the comparison group) in terms of demographics, motivations, course enrollment, engagement and performance. Learners in the target group were primarily male and over 25 years old. A statistically significant portion of the target group held less than a 4-year college degree than the comparison group. Target learners were also significantly underrepresented in the enrollment of the courses examined here. Although the comparison group had a significantly higher completion rate overall than the target group, the target group had a statistically significant higher rate of completing courses with certificates of distinction. This article provides a discussion of these results and suggests how MOOCs could be adapted to better address the needs of learners who feel financially unable to pursue a more traditional path to a post-secondary education.",,INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF RESEARCH IN OPEN AND DISTRIBUTED LEARNING,,ATHABASCA UNIV PRESS,,,

These courses have been adhered by many renowned institutions throughout the world. In Brazil, the SAITE Group along with the Open University of Brazilian National Health System (UNASUS) and its partner, the Federal University of Maranhao (UFMA), have totalized more than 200 thousand registrations in MOOCs in the 2016-2017 biennium. In this process, recognizing that people learn in different manners, and considering the pronounced outreach of MOOCs, a great challenge is to consider ICTs in the pedagogical practice as structuring elements of new learning practices and not only as mere aid tools. This paper presents the experience of the group in the application of the peer evaluation activity as an educational strategy in a massive self-instructional course in distance learning modality. The course in analysis is the Women's health in Primary Care: clinical protocol for nursing, that totalizes 45 hours and 3 modules. In order to approach meaningful learning and provide shared learning processes, we developed a model of peer evaluation activity. The evaluation activities were structured in the following categories: interventions in the health team, which aims to report the experience in the restructuring of work processes in Primary Care (PC); interventions in community, which aims to report the experience of planning actions in partnership with community; and the case report, which aims to report cases that demonstrate the problem-solving characteristic of the health assistance in PC. The activity consisted of two steps: each student should send their activities and then evaluate the activity sent by a colleague. To perform the evaluation, the students had at their disposal an evaluation script based on five-level Likert scale, which provided them with criteria and parameters to be evaluated. In the Virtual Learning Environment (VLE), a friendly interface was developed using the workshop Moodie module. A number of 6,666 students have registered in the course. From this number, 20% performed the first step of the peer evaluation activity. From those who sent the first step, 83% evaluated a colleague's activity (second step). From the students that performed both steps of the activity, 69% performed the course's final activity, reaching certification. The percentage of the students that completed the whole course compared to the total number of students registered was of 11,3%. In each educational module, the students were given the option to evaluate the course. From those who completed the course, 5% answered the evaluation survey, 82% classified the peer evaluation activity with concept good or very good. The average rate of conclusion of MOOCs in the world is between 10% and 15% (Cairo, 2017) and in the digital era we every day more reach competencies from the construction of connections with other people and experiences. Therefore, it is suggested here that the participation rates in the peer evaluation activity in the course abovementioned might be a predictor of motivational factor in the learning process, important methodological tool to consider the diversity of people who followed the course, as well as fundamental element to foster the inter-learning.",,"12TH INTERNATIONAL TECHNOLOGY, EDUCATION AND DEVELOPMENT CONFERENCE (INTED)","12th International Technology, Education and Development Conference (INTED)",IATED-INT ASSOC TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION & DEVELOPMENT,,,

The aim of this study was to investigate learners' behaviours and correlate patterns of Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) with performance and achievement during a MOOC in Implant Dentistry. Methods The clickstream data of learners from the first run of the MOOC Implant dentistry by The University of Hong Kong were modelled and quantified based on Zimmerman's SRL model. The data were quantitatively analysed by means of k-means clustering for evidence of five SRL behavioural indicators of student activity. The clusters identified were then correlated with student engagement and learning performance. Results A total of 7608 individuals enrolled, 5014 engaged (active learners 65.90%), 1277 of them (25.47%) completed the course and 1232 purchased a certificate. Two major groups of learners emerged: Attentive (n = 1433) who were more likely to follow the prescribed pathway in the MOOC and Auditors (n = 3581) who accessed content selectively. There was significantly higher engagement, achievement and completion rates among Attentive than Auditors. Both groups included subcategories (Browser, Digger, Test-driven, Sampler, Persistent) which might reflect different SRL strategies. Conclusion A MOOC in a clinical discipline can achieve high enrolment and completion rates as compared to current benchmarks. There appears to be a wide diversity of learning behaviours among learners, with two however dominant patterns. Learners with a linear learning pathway achieved significantly higher grades and completion rates than those who accessed content irregularly and selectively. Such differences however might be influenced by the demographic and professional background of the learner, as well as their motivation to attending the MOOC. Certain learning behaviours, in particular how learners access content in relation to assessments might be closer related to SRL.",,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF DENTAL EDUCATION,,WILEY,,,

Design: A multicentre, cross-sectional study using a web-based, pilot-tested and self-administered questionnaire. Settings: Ten out of 19 randomly selected medical schools in Egypt. Participants: 2700 undergraduate medical students were randomly selected, with an equal allocation of participants in each university and each study year. Primary and secondary outcome measures: Primary outcome measures were the percentages of students who knew about MOOCs, students who enrolled and students who obtained a certificate. Secondary outcome measures included the limitations and satisfaction of using MOOCs through five-point Likert scale questions. Results: Of 2527 eligible students, 2106 completed the questionnaire (response rate 83.3%). Of these students, 456 (21.7%) knew the term MOOCs or websites providing these courses. Out of the latter, 136 (29.8%) students had enrolled in at least one course, but only 25 (18.4%) had completed courses earning certificates. Clinical year students showed significantly higher rates of knowledge (p=0.009) and enrolment (p<0.001) than academic year students. The primary reasons for the failure of completion of courses included lack of time (105; 77.2%) and slow Internet speed (73; 53.7%). Regarding the 25 students who completed courses, 21 (84%) were satisfied with the overall experience. However, there was less satisfaction regarding student-instructor (8; 32%) and student-student (5; 20%) interactions. Conclusions: About one-fifth of Egyptian medical undergraduates have heard about MOOCs with only about 6.5% actively enrolled in courses.

WebOfScience,Article,"Fedorova, EP; Skobleva, EI",Application of Blockchain Technology in Higher Education,2020,"Emergence and development of the blockchain technology, which is able to transform into a most powerful disruptive innovation, shall definitely concern universities. Moreover, nowadays the blockchain technology meets the challenges that both the system of higher education and the entire society are currently facing. Advantages of the blockchain technology are decentralized open data, absence of forgeries, safe storage of information, and reduction of transaction expenses related to data checkup, control, and verification. This paper provides a critical analysis of application of the blockchain technology considering with its applicability opportunities and restrictions in education; it also aims to identify the consequences of its influence upon the development of education. The article analyzes real cases when this technology was applied, with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) as an example. The MIT applied it to protect and validate the certificates that it issued. Another example is the Sony Global Education that forms individual data on its trainees' competencies and productivity; a third one relates to the University of Nicosia, which was the first to use smart contracts and accept cryptocurrency as a form of payment. The paper also considers the elements of the blockchain technology at universities (both in Russia and outside it), which participate in massive open online courses. It determines the scope of application of this technology in the Russian educational system. In addition, this article provides a literature review related to application of the blockchain technology; the review includes works by such renowned researchers as D. Tapscott, B. Bleir, A. Watters, A. Grech, A. Camilleri, M. Swan, A. Zaslavsky, etc. The paper analyzes the obtained findings of the survey that its authors have conducted among experts, professors, and specialists involved in accreditation. Thus, the paper provides an analysis of opportunities and restrictions related to application of the blockchain technology in higher education.",,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY EDUCATION,,ACAD PUBLISHER HOUSE RESEARCHER SRO,,,

However, there is very little research exploring MOOCs in the discipline of health and medicine. Objective: We aim to provide a review of MOOCs related to health and medicine offered by various MOOC platforms in 2013, by analyzing and comparing the various offerings, their target audience, typical length of course, and credentials offered. We also discuss opportunities and challenges presented by MOOCs in health and medicine. Methods: Health and medicine-related MOOCs were gathered using several methods to ensure the richness and completeness of data. Identified MOOC platform websites were used to gather the lists of offerings. In parallel, these MOOC platforms were contacted to access official data on their offerings. Two MOOC aggregator sites (Class Central and MOOC List) were also consulted to gather data on MOOC offerings. Eligibility criteria were defined to concentrate on the courses that were offered in 2013 and primarily on the subject of health and medicine. All language translations in this paper were done using Google Translate. Results: The search identified 225 courses, of which 98 were eligible for the review. Over half (58%, 57/98) of the MOOCs considered were offered on the Coursera platform, and 94% (92/98) of all the MOOCs were offered in English. Universities offered 90 MOOCs, and the John Hopkins University offered the largest number of MOOCs (12/90). Only three MOOCs were offered by developing countries (China, West Indies, and Saudi Arabia). The duration of MOOCs varied from 3-20 weeks with an average length of 6.7 weeks. On average, MOOCs expected a participant to work on the material for 4.2 hours a week. Verified certificates were offered by 14 MOOCs, while three others offered other professional recognition. Conclusions: The review presents evidence to suggest that MOOCs can be used as a way to provide continuous medical education. It also shows the potential of MOOCs as a means of increasing health literacy among the public.",,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,,"JMIR PUBLICATIONS, INC",,,
WebOfScience,Proceedings Paper,"Onah, DFO; Sinclair, J; Boyatt, R",DROPOUT RATES OF MASSIVE OPEN ONLINE COURSES: BEHAVIOURAL PATTERNS,2014,"Massive open online courses (MOOCs) have received wide publicity and many institutions have invested considerable effort in developing, promoting and delivering such courses. However, there are still many unresolved questions relating to MOOCs and their effectiveness. One of the major recurring issues raised in both academic literature and the popular press is the consistently high dropout rate of MOOC learners. Although many thousands of participants enrol on these courses, the completion rate for most courses is below 13%. This paper investigates MOOC attrition from several different perspectives. Firstly, we review existing literature relating to MOOC dropout rates, bringing together existing findings on completion rates and analyses of several specific courses, which identify factors that correlate to likelihood of dropout. We provide a meta-analysis of the basic figures on overall dropout rates previously collected to identify relationships between course factors and dropout rates. In addition, the literature is reviewed from a qualitative perspective drawing together findings on the reasons for dropout and methods suggested for resolving or reducing the dropout rate. Secondly, using themes emerging from the initial investigation, we provide a preliminary analysis of data gathered from a Computing MOOC run by the University of Warwick, UK and presented using a Moodle platform. Different aspects of students' demographic data are examined to see if relationships to persistence exist. An important feature of this course is that it has been run in two different parallel modes (traditional MOOC mode with peer support, and supported mode with real time, tutored programming labs). This allows direct comparison between the dropout figures for the two different modes. Qualitative information from student evaluations is also considered. Finally, we discuss our findings relating MOOC dropout rates, considering what factors are within the control of a MOOC provider and suggesting the most promising avenues for improvement. Our results indicate that many participants who may be classed as dropouts (for example, because they do not complete the necessary components to gain a certificate) are still participating in the course in their own preferred way (either at a slower pace or with selective engagement). This suggests that the structure of a course may not be helpful to all participants and supporting different patterns of engagement and presentation of material may be beneficial.",,EDULEARN14: 6TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON EDUCATION AND NEW LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES,6th International Conference on Education and New Learning Technologies (EDULEARN),IATED-INT ASSOC TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION & DEVELOPMENT,,,

Promoted by the significant increase of large scale internet access, many audiences turned to the web and its resources, for learning and inspiration, with a diverse set of skills and intents. MOOC (Massive Open Online Courses) is a learning model, supported on web tools, that is accessible to anyone with a minimum of digital literacy. The inclusive MOOC aims to promote the social inclusion of the deaf and blind communities. Promoting equal opportunities to all and assuring the social inclusion of the disadvantaged is one of the main concerns of modern societies and a key topic in the European Higher Education field. Nevertheless, despite the efforts being made there is still not enough support for the deaf and blind communities. MOOCs are relatively new in the Portuguese higher education context but very popular abroad. MOOCs aims to close the gap between information and its seekers. Under the MOOC learning module, an unlimited number of trainees may attend a class with a single teacher. Personalized training is promoted with adjustable schedules. The MOOC is certified. The use of new technologies, allied to sound educational practices, will lead to a strong human cognitive development able of providing full access to the digital world for blind and/or hearing impaired people. It is intended to create a pedagogical and inclusive MOOC model that allows the integration of deaf and blind community with support of some tools allowing, inclusion and equal opportunities. Creating a pedagogical MOOC model and integrate it with the Virtual Sign system which allows the automatic translation in real-time between text/voice/gesture, will create the digital educational resources for deaf and blind, contributing in this way to their integration into society. The Quantitative Evaluation Framework (QEF) approach was selected for the evaluation to highlight the strengths and limitations of the inclusive MOOC. The approach has been adapted so that the essential criteria are assessed in a pre-evaluation phase, covering the general usage requirements.",,EDULEARN18: 10TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON EDUCATION AND NEW LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES,10th International Conference on Education and New Learning Technologies (EDULEARN),IATED-INT ASSOC TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION & DEVELOPMENT,,,

Resistance to antibacterial drugs is particularly important in the region. This paper describes the design, implementation and results of an international bi-lingual (Spanish and Portuguese) online continuing interprofessional interactive educational program on hospital-acquired infections and antimicrobial resistance for Latin America, supported by the American Society for Microbiology. MethodsParticipation, satisfaction and knowledge gain (through pre and post tests) were used. Moreover, commitment to change statements were requested from participants at the end of the course and three months later. ResultsThere were 1169 participants from 19 Latin American countries who registered: 57% were physicians and 43% were other health care professionals. Of those, 1126 participated in the course, 46% received a certificate of completion and 54% a certificate of participation. There was a significant increase in knowledge between before and after the course. Of 535 participants who took both tests, the grade increased from 59 to 81%.

MOOC topics show the different pathological postural patterns and possible postural and technological adjustments that enable physical motor control. You will learn to design and build with the help of Low-Cost Philosophy. The last module will facilitate the game-based learning where individual adjustments will be made for people with functional diversity. This study is focused on exploring teachers' perspectives on difficulties in building and developing a health-related MOOC. The role of teachers in the assessment procedures of this course besides is considered. METHODOLOGY: Qualitative research was performed with an eidetic phenomenological analysis through semi-structured in-depth interviews. The thematic categories have been defining upon assessment tools used in the MOOC, through the experiences and difficulties during the planning and design of this course. RESULTS: development of MOOC has demonstrated to be a procedure of enriching collaborative learning, through which it has been possible to transmit knowledge of the different professionals. The first difficulty that we have found was the develop schedule and course planning, because it is very difficult to achieve the dates when you rely on a large group of teachers. Collaborative work is very enriching, during the design of the course you become a facilitator of the content and you are filled with satisfaction when you achieve the expected outcome after many long months of work. However, such development has brought a number of challenges that the teachers have faced in the design of the audiovisual content. The creation of the MOOC was a big challenge because it is a new format in which the theoretical main content of a course has been summarized into small didactic and short videos. Respondents mentioned as an impediment to reduce video time. Because it is essential that the content of the video keeps the interest and motivation of the participants. At the same time, loss of information should be avoided in this process and the import idea should be organized in order to not repeat the content in various modules. One of the main challenges in the MOOC is to reduce the number of dropout rate by providing content that is attractive and stimulating to the student. During the qualitative research, teachers concluded that the assessment was dynamic, active and participatory. A mixed assessment will be used, through engagement with and participation in online discussion forums and to evaluate cumulative achievement at the end of each module. A preliminary assessment will be made before starting the course content. An assessment could be enhanced through learner analytics (LA), analysis of quantitative audience usage data generated by video-sharing platforms. Students make all cumulative assessments at the end of the modules will receive the certificate of completion of the course. CONCLUSION: teachers agreed on the importance of generating discussion and exchange of knowledge among participants to enable and encourage creativity. The most common difficulty was to summarize the content of the video to achieve the motivation of the participant in MOOC.",,EDULEARN19: 11TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON EDUCATION AND NEW LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES,11th International Conference on Education and New Learning Technologies (EDULEARN),IATED-INT ASSOC TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION & DEVELOPMENT,,,

We developed a massive open online course (MOOC), The Science of Safety in Healthcare, to present the foundational patient safety principles to a broad global audience of health professionals, learners, and patients interested in patient safety. Objectives: To describe the Science of Safety in Healthcare MOOC, its effects on patient safety competence, and the satisfaction of course participants. Methods: The five-week video-based course was delivered in 2013 and 2014, and was organized in five modules: 1) overview of science of safety and safety culture, 2) enabling and contextual factors that influence patient safety and quality, 3) methods to improve safety and quality, 4) translating evidence intro practice and leading change, and 5) summary and opportunities for capacity building. Each module had three or four segments. Participants were introduced to key concepts, and tools and skills to promote patient safety. Participants completed the Health Professional Education in Patient Safety Survey (H-PEPSS), which measures patient safety competence, and a course satisfaction survey. Pre- and post- course H-PEPSS scores were compared using paired t-tests. Course satisfaction surveys were administered at the completion of the course and six months later. Results: A total of 20,957, and 9679 participants enrolled in the course in 2013 and 2014, respectively. About half of participants were 25-44 years old (57%), and female (54%). Participants joined from over 100 countries. The majority were health professionals (61%) or health professionals in training (7%). Mean H-PEPSS scores improved after course completion, with significant increases on all survey domains in both years (p < 0.01). Mean score differences were: Teamwork 0.68 (95% CI: 0.64, 0.71), Communication 0.70 (95% CI: 0.66, 0.73), Managing Risk 0.79 (95% CI: 0.76, 0.82), Human Environment 0.64 (95% CI: 0.61, 0.68), Recognizing and Responding 0.64 (95% CI: 0.61, 0.68), and Culture 0.72 (95% CI: 0.68, 0.75). About 8% of participants in each cohort earned a certificate of completion. At 6-months post-course, the majority of the participants agreed or agreed strongly that the course content was useful (93%) and that the course positively influenced their clinical practice (69%) and communication (84%). Conclusions: The MOOC course allowed educators to reach a large, diverse audience. The course was wellreceived and participants reported a significant increase in patient safety competence.

WebOfScience,Proceedings Paper,"Alecu, AA; Pavaloiu, BI; Dobre-Trifan, CG",A Novel Free Cloud Service for Machine Learning and Beyond,2019,"The concept of eLearning has grown exponentially in recent years. Indeed, what was but a few decades ago exclusively reserved for classroom attendees of university institutions and their closed intranets has today become a publicly accessible source of information, with public and private-owned eLearning MOOC (Massive Open Online Courses) platforms dominating the digital landscape and bringing with them a plethora of services such as video courses, certifications and employee recruitment. Nonetheless, while adding significant public value, such platforms still fail to completely bridge the gap between academia and industry in the hands-on knowledge application sense. This is especially true for domains such as machine learning that are known to require tremendous computational resources if one wishes to transition from simplistic lab exercises to complex state-of-the-art models, which is something a MOOC - or most academic institutions for that matter - simply cannot afford. Private cloud providers have taken up the challenge here and opened their offerings to the research community with programs such as TensorFlow Research Cloud, Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK) on Azure, Apache MXNet on Amazon AWS, to name but a few. Nonetheless, access to such resources remains limited: either the resources themselves are scarce and consequently freely available only to a restricted research community, or they are free for a limited time, or they follow a freemium model. This paper describes a novel distributed publicly-hosted overlay network that provides free collaborative eLearning material and computational resources to its users. Unlike most of its P2P counterparts in existence today that address alternative public needs (i.e. anonymity, file sharing,.), it offers unlimited runtime access to all the computational resources that collectively define its topology. In this respect, an example use case is one wherein a distributed machine learning system can be orchestrated by any user and freely deployed for execution on any number of available nodes within the network, without any limitation other than that of the underlying hardware and network latency performance capabilities themselves. Additionally, source code and accompanying eLearning courses are regularly published to the network and made freely available by users belonging to the academic and subject matter expert practitioner community, implementing solutions ranging from simple classroom exercises to entire production-ready systems. The network is collaborative by design, such that learning material can be collectively worked on and published, training data can be shared and successfully deployed software solutions can be load-balanced and made accessible to the entire community. Moreover, the distributed network follows a decentralized model governed only by a handful of master nodes that, similarly to all its other nodes, are hosted by the users themselves, and in this sense constitutes a novel cloud offering maintained by the general public rather than any given private cloud provider. Finally, we argue that beyond its educational and computational power offerings, the described network likely constitutes the best test platform for any designed software system: indeed, given the volatile nature of the network (wherein user-hosted resources can join or go offline at any moment), we claim that any software system that can survive and maintain its levels of SLA (service level agreement) on this network is guaranteed to perform similarly or better on a more traditional pay-per-usage cloud provider infrastructure.",,"NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND REDESIGNING LEARNING SPACES, VOL I",15th International Scientific Conference on eLearning and Software for Education (eLSE) - New Technologies and Redesigning Learning Spaces,CAROL I NATL DEFENCE UNIV PUBLISHING HOUSE,,,

WebOfScience,Article; Early Access,"Semenova, T",Not Only the Intention to Complete: The Role of Action-Oriented Intentions in MOOC Completion,,"Some researchers have questioned the use of dropout metrics to assess the quality of MOOCs. The main reason for this doubt is that participants register for online courses with different intentions. Therefore, it is proposed to use a learner-centred approach and to study the learner intention-fulfilment. Researchers studied the effect of result-oriented intention on MOOC completion. However, studies in traditional educational settings have shown that a more significant predictor of behavior is not result-oriented intention, but action-oriented intention. In our paper, we expand the study of the intention-to-behavior relation in MOOCs and identify the role of strong positive action-oriented intentions in MOOCs. As strong positive action-oriented intentions, we identified two types of intention: intention to watch all the video lectures and intention to complete all the tasks. The research database consists of trace data and survey data collected among participants of 5 MOOCs launched in the spring semester of 2017. Survey data recorded one result-oriented intention (to earn a certificate) and the two strong positive action-oriented intentions. The results showed, first, a significant relationship between strong positive action-oriented intentions and behavior in MOOCs. Secondly, we found that the intention to watch lectures and to complete tasks are conceptually different intentions: the intention to watch lectures does not play a significant role in course completion compared to the intention to complete all the tasks. Thirdly, we found that the strong positive action-oriented intention to complete all the tasks is a more powerful predictor of course completion than the result-oriented intention. These results can be used to adjust interventions that are embedded in the courses to increase their effectiveness.",,TECHNOLOGY KNOWLEDGE AND LEARNING,,SPRINGER,,,

Course offerings will change over time; certification requirements will be updated, and new providers will appear. Practical implications By identifying sources of supply chain training that are currently available to help bridge this serious skill shortage, the results can serve as a guide to enterprises moving toward supply chain digitalization. Social implications To succeed in the current environment of digital transformation, employees need opportunities to build digital skills that are demanded by corporations around the world. This is especially important at a time when unemployment is at an alarming rate.

Now that MOOCs have been in wide use, in this study we took an updated look at learners' perspective of taking MOOCs designed for working professionals and course aspects that these MOOC participants found beneficial. General interest in the topic, personal growth and enrichment, relevance to job, and career change were the top reasons for working professionals to enroll in MOOCs. First-time MOOC takers were more likely to seek a certificate, while MOOC veterans may complete most assignments but did not seek for a certificate. Quality materials from a reputable provider remains an important reason for working professionals to enroll in a MOOC.

This paper describes practice examples of a curriculum-integrated program for students using a self-assessment-tool in order to improve students' digital competences, help them evaluate their own competence levels and assist them in independently closing their competence gaps. Both the curriculum-integrated program for digital competences and the self-assessment tool are based around the European Digital Competence Framework for Citizens. The curriculum-integrated program DigKom Nuremberg-Tech is an initiative that provides digital key competences for students of all disciplines at the Nuremberg Public Institute of Technology Georg-Simon-Ohm since 2017. The Digital Competence Wheel is an online self-assessment tool developed by Center for Digital Dannelse in Copenhagen, launched in 2016. The DigKom Nuremberg-Tech program is structured as a modular concept. Students can choose a part of the program according to their interest and individual needs or they can participate in the whole program and apply for a certificate for digital competences. It consists of two formats: interactive workshops and interdisciplinary lectures, which are integrated in the module General Studies and recognized with ECTS. DigKom Nuremberg-Tech has three goals: Goal 1: Help students to better understand current topics and trends from different fields of digital competences Participants acquire knowledge of digital learning, data literacy, digital ethics, industry 4.0. They get familiar and practice technologies and techniques, especially for obtaining, analysing and evaluating information, security and handling of their own data, communication using digital media, creating digital contents like websites, apps, information design, etc. Other relevant key competences are additionally trained within the program, especially agile work management, critical thinking and team working. Goal 2: Support the lifelong learning skills of students in the digital age DigKom offers two courses on Learning, Self-Organization and Motivation 4.0 as well as OER and MOOCs - the way to expand knowledge and continuing self-education. Participants identify their own knowledge gaps and areas of interest, try new digital tools and suitable online educational learning platforms and document their learning experiments on online learning portfolios. Goal 3: Promote self-reflection and assessment of competence levels The Digital Competence Wheel helps students estimate their current competence levels. Through a series of self-assessment statements, the students reflect on and score their own everyday practice. Upon completion, the students are presented with personal competence profiles, which visually illustrate their competence strengths and weaknesses as well as include supplementary information for upskilling. Thus, students can formulate a strategy on how best to develop their strengths in the future and how to independently close their competence gaps. Together, the three-pronged approach to competence assessment and development provides students with hands-on experience with new technologies, first-hand insights into own strengths and weaknesses as well as theoretical knowledge of current competence demands. Focusing on the individuals' capabilities enables students with tools to further guide their lifelong learning.",,"14TH INTERNATIONAL TECHNOLOGY, EDUCATION AND DEVELOPMENT CONFERENCE (INTED2020)","14th International Technology, Education and Development Conference (INTED)",IATED-INT ASSOC TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION & DEVELOPMENT,,,

Therefore, this study investigated learners' explicit behaviors and implicit discourse content derived from reviews by using a mixed approach of text mining and statistical analysis. We proposed an improved topic model called Behavior-Emotion Topic Model (BETM) to detect reviews' semantic content between two achievement groups (completers and non-completers). Then we performed statistical analysis to investigate differences in the two groups' discourse behaviors and content. Results showed significant differences in discourse behaviors and focused topics between completers and non-completers. Specifically, posting reviews was a significant behavior for completers, while replying and giving peers' reviews thumps up were significant behaviors for non-completers. Furthermore, completers tended to express appreciation of course-related content by posting reviews and, afterward, showing certificates, whereas non-completers tended to hold negative attitudes toward the platform construction's technical issues by replying. Finally, we conducted an evolutionary analysis to explore the dynamics of learners' focused content throughout the course over 3 years; this can provide instructors new insights for the development of online course, thus meeting future learners' needs by adjusting the teaching process.",,COMPUTERS & EDUCATION,,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,,,

The MicroMasters series is comprised of four courses with a capstone assessment. When the courses closed in December 2018, a review was undertaken of the participation levels and achievement outcomes of participants in both the verified and audit enrollment modes. The total enrollment in all courses in the MicroMasters was 22,093. The proportion of participants who enrolled in the verified enrollment mode was less than 2.5% per course. The proportion of verified participants who passed (achieved 70% or higher in the final grade) ranged between 29-67%, with the more technical courses having the lower pass rates. A total of 134 course certificates were delivered to 95 participants enrolled in one or more of the four courses, with over three quarters of participants who received a course certificate only achieving one certificate. Verified participants take time to achieve four certificates which has implications for articulation to on-campus or external Master programs and first and second semester entry points. If MOOCs are to be part of a university's delivery mode there will need to be a large increase in the number of students electing and paying to be part of the verified enrollment mode to justify the development costs and ongoing support required to run such a series.

One of the unique advantages of online courses is that all the content can be assessed and analyzed even before the courses arc released using various learning analytical and natural language processing tools. However, to date there are few studies in the literature published on the analysis of MOOC content. Furthermore, MOOC providers expect the course developers to periodically revise their MOOCs. Various types of analysis that can be done on the course text, video transcripts and assessments such as readability, listenability, videolytics, and text analysis. By analyzing the course content before its release, the content can be adjusted to target various learners. Subsequently, the same techniques can be used to analyze the discussion board posts and post-course survey to identify areas in a course that need to be modified in to order to improve the course quality for subsequent release.

In two computational thinking and programming MOOCs, we first confirm the doer effect for all certificate earners in short and long term grade outcomes. This leads to asking: Is the doer effect similar when experienced learners are compared to novices? Is it present, regardless of the topic being taught? We find the doer effect varies in magnitude across learners of different experience level and topics, suggesting that the importance of practice depends on the topic and the learner's background.

Competency-based education (CBE) is a paradigm that can combine the both benefits. Linked data technology has potentials that help education to be more oriented towards CBE by linking the education with competences fields such as labour. However, that needs the education courses to be updated according to labours' demands which require lifelong learning to make individuals kept up with the emerging competences and technologies. CBE and lifelong learning are related to open education such as OCWs, MOOCs and OERs; since MOOCs for example give the chance to learn from the industry leaders which is very effective for CBE and can be acquired anytime. Also, open education is more responsive to the emerging demands of labour. Based on that, traditional universities have a possibility to update their courses based on the CBE rather than starting from scratch. Therefore, making mutual integration between traditional and open education courses based on labours' competences can offer an opportunity to go towards CBE. In this paper we propose a novel approach to refine education courses to be more oriented towards CBE by this mutuality integration. Input to this approach is the course information and the output is lists of candidate competences concepts that a course designer can use to refine current courses' topics and learning outcomes based on labour skills. Also developing a new metrics is suggested based on conducting some statistics to measure the importance of the concept regarding the CBE and measure how much the whole course is related to the labour needs. Lastly, developing a bridged model based on the competences concepts to be as anchors is suggested to provide links to the related OERs and related courses from MOOCS/OCWs.",,2019 2ND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER APPLICATIONS & INFORMATION SECURITY (ICCAIS),2nd International Conference on Computer Applications and Information Security (ICCAIS),IEEE,,,

On the one hand, these aspects have been evaluated by students in a positive way, on the other hand, with a negative meaning. Some examples reported by students are: the video lectures, appreciated for their duration and clarity, at the same time are also considered as a weakness for their sameness; the absence of prerequisites that assure free access to the MOOCs is necessary for students in order to facilitate self-evaluation before enrolling; the communication tools as chat and forum to communication, sharing and collaboration with peer and teachers are the only way for social learning; the assessment is quite debated for the type of test that is mainly represented by multiple choice; the inclusive dimension is mainly considered for its weaknesses about the little presence of compensatory tools reserved to people with disabilities; the role of the Tutor is mandatory during the learning processes through individual feedback; the certificate of attendance represents a strength that could become a weakness for its little usefulness in the professional contexts.",,"13TH INTERNATIONAL TECHNOLOGY, EDUCATION AND DEVELOPMENT CONFERENCE (INTED2019)","13th International Technology, Education and Development Conference (INTED)",IATED-INT ASSOC TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION & DEVELOPMENT,,,

Despite lower student persistent rates, faculty skepticism, and burdensome faculty workloads, the general public and administrative embrace of online learning has been enthusiastic, which may be explained in part using Foucault's concept of the episteme to view the convergence of the parallel tracks of educational and technological development--the idea of a kind of mechanism for learning. While MOOCs once promised best professors, other institutions now promise the best designed mechanisms for learning, certified through corporatized quality assurance programs and learning management systems. While this may be appropriate for shopping educational products in a neoliberal marketplace, it seldom addresses human needs.

However, discussion on the implementation of blended learning through MOOC is still insufficient. Therefore, this study aims to investigate and discuss blended learning implementation for a Data Structure subject with MOOC. Moreover, there are not many studies on students' interaction with other university students. Therefore, apart from reporting on course implementation, performance and satisfaction, this study undertakes analysis of students' participation and interaction within Malaysia and global communities. Results of this study are expected to help in improving student's interaction and setting the course direction. This study uses statistical analysis and social network analysis. The analysis aims to reveal the participation and interaction patterns among Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) students with students from other universities and other countries. The study found that there is still lack of interaction among UTM students with students from other universities. However, as expected, there is higher participation by UTM students, compare to other students. Therefore, the study encourages students to broaden their network through knowledge sharing and exchange of ideas to increase understanding and benefit more from the subject offered. Additionally, other issues that have been discussed include certification, course design and structure, and provision of feedback.

In order to guarantee that the evaluation procedures are in line with the quality of the procedures traditionally established in the university, a proposal for an enhanced peer assessment is required to allow a more precise review of the students' tasks and the assessments provided by his colleagues, considering procedures of verification of originality and a complete rubric for the peer review that takes into account reviewer's history for a correct grade calibration. This paper describes the implementation of the evaluation tool, and an experimental validation that indicates that the majority of the students who have used the tool for the revision of assignments have generated grades closer to the revisions generated by the professors in the study.",,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES IN LEARNING,,KASSEL UNIV PRESS GMBH,,,
WebOfScience,Article,"Costello, E; Brunton, J; Brown, M; Daly, L",In MOOCs we Trust: Learner Perceptions of MOOC Quality via Trust and Credibility,2018,"In this study we sought to examine MOOC learners' levels of trust in the platforms, institutions, and instructors involved in MOOC design and delivery. We sought to examine what influenced learners' conceptualizations of trust in MOOCs and how this might influence their future intentions towards the related MOOC providers. To this end we examined whether an increase in perceived source credibility of the MOOC increased trusting beliefs of the MOOC learner. Furthermore, we examined whether increases in trusting beliefs of the MOOC learner would lead to an increase in their future trusting intentions. This second question has implications for whether a learner persists in their learning or decides to commit to further study pathways such as paid certificates. In addition to testing these two hypotheses we sought to determine the most significant underlying drivers that learners reported as affecting their trust in MOOCs they undertook. Drawing on concepts of trust from the literature, we adapted and developed a survey instrument and recruited MOOC learners to respond. Following analysis of 76 responses we found a positive correlation between source credibility and learner trust in MOOCs. Further there was also a positive correlation found between trust in MOOCs and learners' professed future intentions. Finally, we determined several component factors of MOOC trust drivers as reported by MOOC learners. Our work holds potential implications for MOOC platform developers, instructors, and designers in signposting areas where MOOC learners have positive and negative experiences of MOOCs, which can in turn influence their future relationship with the MOOC providers.",,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES IN LEARNING,,KASSEL UNIV PRESS GMBH,,,
WebOfScience,Article,"DeBrock, L",The New Face-to-Face Education Scalable Live-Engagement,2018,"The iMBA, which is delivered 100% online, was launched by Gies College of Business at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2016. By fall of 2018, the program will enroll more than 1,700 students from 70 countries. With its US$22,000 tuition, about 1/3 the price of programs of similar caliber, the iMBA is reaching under-served populations, including those unable to pay premium prices or make time for in-person residency as well as late-career learners who are disinclined to attend a conventional program. One of the iMBA's major breakthroughs is its scalability, and that scalability has been accomplished in ways that enhance the quality of education. An iMBA course has two main components - an open MOOC, which delivers core concepts equivalent to what might be covered in a conventional in-person lecture, plus a live global classroom led by a professor and supported by a team of course assistants. As the MOOC delivers the fundamentals of a topic, the live-engagement class focuses on a richer exploration of the material. In the live-engagement classes, hundreds of students can participate simultaneously - yet receive significant individual attention and personalization by interacting with professors and course assistants in real time through chat technology. Students also interact with each other, which often results in side topics being explored, thus producing a richer environment for knowledge discovery than would be possible in a traditional lecture hall in which side conversations are discouraged. Course assistants answer basic questions, and elevate particularly important insights or questions to the professor at the head of the full class, also in real time. Another distinctive feature of the iMBA is that it is delivered in stackable components: A MOOC plus live-engagement element stacks into a for-credit course. A series of for-credit courses stack plus a capstone project stacks into a Specialization. In turn, a series of Specializations stack into the full MBA degree. In this way, students have various on-ramps to the full degree. The iMBA has to a significant degree cured the cost disease in higher education. Faculty create content for multiple uses - for the full MBA as well as for certificate programs, for example - producing multiple revenue streams. Plus classes can be large owing to the novel teaching-team structure, enabling one senior faculty member to potentially teach thousands.",,VOPROSY OBRAZOVANIYA-EDUCATIONAL STUDIES MOSCOW,,NATL RES UNIV HIGHER SCH ECONOMICS,,,

This paper proposes the MOOC Affordances Model (MOOC-AM) for characterizing a MOOC. The MOOC-AM consists of eight dimensions of affordances: 1) Massiveness, 2) Openness, 3) Interaction, Communication, Cooperation & Collaboration, 4) Personalization & Adaptation, 5) Autonomy, Choice & Control, 6) Support, Scaffolding, Help, Facilitation, Assistance, Feedback & Recommendations, 7) Mobility & Ubiquity, and 8) Accreditation, Certification & Assessment. In order to illustrate the application of the MOOC-AM, MOOCs on Programming in Python were examined regarding the affordances they provide. The findings reveal that none MOOC excels in all eight affordances.

However, many students who enroll in this type of courses drop out before completion. Several circumstances may cause dropout at any stage of the course and, in any case, before getting the certificate. Some students are not able to follow the course, others fail in the exams and leave, others only aim at getting a general overview of the course contents, others take all the activities but the final test, because of being interested in gaining knowledge but not in obtaining the certificate, etc. For this reason, it is interesting to analyze and understand the behavior of each student while interacting with the course. In this direction, the goal of this work is to predict whether a student will abandon a MOOC before completing it, so that it is possible to intervene accordingly, by warning the teacher about the dropout risk, notifying the student about this risk, etc. Different machine learning techniques have been tested with real data of a MOOC supported by EdX at UAM.

Therefore, it is desired that alternative methods should be adopted to reduce the gap between the required number of qualified teachers and the actually available. As the technology is evolving rapidly, Massively Open Online Courses (MOOCs) appears to be an imminent concept which allows the students to use the IT infrastructure to learn while sitting at their home or workplace. MOOCs help the students to nurture problem-solving capabilities in them with the help of a plethora of online courses in diverse fields. Learners can choose courses of their interest and acquire a certificate of the same. This paper explores the concept and benefits of MOOCs in today's scenario, its advantages like freedom from geographic boundaries, flexibility, optimal cost, better educational outcomes. Further, this paper highlights challenges and limitations towards implementing MOOCs such as the dearth of infrastructure in developing countries, absence of proper assessment method, invalidity of such courses in conventional degree level programs, lack of practical sessions, and dropout rate. Significant developments in the field of MOOCs are ongoing in India under the banner of Ministry of Human Resource Development's project SWAYAM (Study Webs of Active-Learning for Young Aspiring Minds). Nature Journal survey has shown that India ranked second in the world to access MOOCs services.

A main feature shared by both of them is that they use Open edX content management platform. On the other hand, it has become more feasible nowadays to convert some of Open Courses into University MOOCs on account of the updated Open eClass 3.6 version they use. In our study we fully compare Open edX characteristics (as it is used in Greek MOOCs) with Open eClass new version. Moreover, we compare Open Delos multiform material platform with videos uploaded on Greek MOOCs. Our aim is to find out whether we can convert, from a technological point of view, some of Open Courses into MOOCs. Some of the issues we are going to deal with are the creation of e-portfolio subsystems and mind maps and finding out whether or not they can aid within the context of an organized MOOC. Furthermore, we will cope with such issues as marking-assessment and Certification of participants in these courses. We will suggest solutions to one of the main problems posed by MOOC critics, that is the one of participants' identification, recommending the tool of plagiarism check, embedded in Open eClass new version. All these are presented through the prism of a search into the utilization of Open Courses as an organized form of Secondary Education teachers training.",,EDULEARN18: 10TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON EDUCATION AND NEW LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES,10th International Conference on Education and New Learning Technologies (EDULEARN),IATED-INT ASSOC TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION & DEVELOPMENT,,,

The discussion around MOOCs is growing too, however, much of that is centered around technological or certification-related issues. There are still not many advances in the pedagogical format, and many MOOCs end up being an online version of the traditional lecture format. At the same time, several problems have been reported, such as, lack of learner engagement, low participation in forums and low completion rates. To address these challenges, we present the Learner-Centric MOOC model: a prescriptive model consisting of a set of guidelines, activity formats and actions for MOOC creators. The LCM model guides instructors in conceptualizing, creating and conducting a MOOC, while maintaining a learner-centric pedagogical approach at its core. The LCM model consists of four structural elements: Learning Dialogs, Learning by Doing activities, Learning Experience Interaction and Learning Extension Trajectories, and Orchestration dynamics. In this paper, we describe the structural and dynamic aspects of the LCM model, show its application in various MOOCs and illustrate evaluation results from MOOCs based on LCM model.",,2018 IEEE TENTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON TECHNOLOGY FOR EDUCATION (T4E),IEEE Tenth International Conference on Technology for Education (T4E),IEEE,,,

It is a brand-new teaching form that connects the Internet with teaching activities based on network technology. Compared with traditional teaching methods, MOOC has the characteristics of large-scale, online and open. The course is based on network technology, so the spatial location is no longer the main factor limiting the classroom capacity. A course of up to 100,000 students can be online at the same time. Throughout the process, teachers and students communicate and communicate through the Internet to complete homework and assessment. Learning results and even issuing assessment certificates have greatly improved the efficiency of teaching; teachers and students are engaged in teaching activities under an open condition, and anyone, any time, anywhere can participate in the class. It can be said that MOOC is a major reform in the field of teaching. As a typical representative of public foundation courses in colleges and universities, the traditional ideological and political courses are still based on classroom teaching. In the mode of MOOC, teachers in the ideological and political teaching activities are positioned as for the disseminators of teaching content, the main teaching objectives should also emphasize the motivation of students to learn and cultivate students' learning methods. Therefore, the ideological and political teaching activities based on MOOCs emphasize the cultivation of students' self-learning ability. Based on this, the paper discusses the influence of MOOC teaching on the reform of ideological and political teaching in colleges and universities.",,"2018 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON EDUCATION, PSYCHOLOGY, AND MANAGEMENT SCIENCE (ICEPMS 2018)","International Conference on Education, Psychology, and Management Science (ICEPMS)",FRANCIS ACAD PRESS,,,

This study took 621 courses of 14 major MOOC platforms in China as the research object, investigated their learning support condition, and compared the types and quantity of learning support services (LSS) provided by different types of courses. The study found that, in general, China's MOOCs supply very few types of LSS, and the overall level of support service was low. There are big differences in learning support among MOOCs with different teaching models. Inquiry-based courses designed better learning support than lecture-based courses. Flipped-classroom MOOCs used learning support more often. The learning support in MOOCs was more traditionally designed. Courses with well-designed certificate system had better learning support.

In order to address this challenge, in this paper it is proposed a new type of P2P activity, designed to automatically provide students a valuable feedback about their work. This new type of activity is supported by a module, including a coordination engine and a formal revision component communicating by means of the LTI protocol with an automatic revision assistant, which allows differentiating a genuine contribution from the simple repetition of ideas.

In this context a broad definition is adopted of flexible learners, which includes adult learners in part-time and/or online/distance education. A number of national and international reports have emphasised the importance of bringing more adult learners into higher education, and adult learners have a preference for flexible programmes. The MOOC targets prospective learners during early parts of the study life-cycle, when they are considering entry into higher education and may benefit from advice about how to effectively prepare. The MOOC utilises a number of the OERs developed by the Student Success Toolbox project, and combines these readiness tools with supporting materials in order to deliver a comprehensive pre-induction socialisation course. A small pilot ran from the 15th Aug-19th Sept 2016. 150 people enrolled with 50 going on to receive a certificate of completion. Those selected to take part in this pilot were prospective flexible learners planning to start courses in Ireland in 2016/2017 and a cohort of approximately 70 learners from Kiron, an organisation supporting refugees in accessing higher education.

WebOfScience,Proceedings Paper,"Croft, I",USING MARGINAL GAINS TO IMPROVE MOOCS AND SPOCS,2017,"A leading online platform suggests that in five years, all institutions will offer certified degrees in the form of MOOCs or SPOCs. This provider, Coursera, has acquired over 15 million students and 130 partners in four years, whilst little brother EdX has racked up 5 million users and 70 institutions. To put those numbers into perspective, combined, that's 50 times more students than have ever been to Harvard. So what's the problem? The problem is that the horse has bolted. MOOCs and SPOCs aren't news to anyone. Technologically aware universities have produced them for years, and there will be a wave of new entrants in the coming months. In November 2016, Oxford University announced that it would be launching its first MOOC. The competition is growing. Every university will soon be trying to grab a slice of this very large pie. So how do we stay ahead of the curve, and compete with Ivy League institutions and Old Masters whom have years of prestige and history on their side?. To answer that, I need to digress to the world British Cycling. Dave Brailsford was brought in as an advisor in 1997 after the unsuccessful 1996 Olympics, where GB only won 2 medals. His arrival saw an improvement four years later, which prompted British Cycling to make him Performance Director, and with it his philosophy of `Marginal Gains'. He recognised that his small island couldn't rival the likes of the US in terms of numbers, nor Germany or France in terms of tradition or cycling culture - so where could they compete? In every other way: bike mechanics, riders' clothing, diet, sleep schedules, to name a few. If they could improve all these little things by a fraction, maybe they would amount something bigger. The results were spectacular. In 2004, the UK came third in the medal table. In 2008 and 2012? First. Whilst you can't improve one thing by 100%, you can improve 100 by 1%. 100 things to improve in MOOCs? Everywhere you look; from the speed of your reply in the forum, to the accuracy of the videos' subtitles. However, for my presentation, I want to focus on one - using technology and alternative videos to enhance quality. I will show participants how they can use marginal gains to increase the quality of MOOCs and SPOCs to compete with leading institutions. One way to differentiate, is by using a LED Board. Used in dark room, the professor stands behind a transparent LED lit screen and writes in a white pen - a modern way of displaying tables, matrices or diagrams. Another, is by altering the location of the video. Imagine you are doing a course on Pricing Strategy - what better way to explain the differences between premium and budget pricing than by recording at a bustling and iconic market in your city. Is a Professor from Spain or India ever going to sound as natural and fluent in English as one from California? Probably not. Can they produce a more engaging video through the use of technology or location despite that? Yes. At IE we've embraced this philosophy in order to maintain our excellent reputation in blended and face-to-face education. Over three years, we have launched 20 MOOCs, sustaining impressive ratings; the highest ranked courses achieving 4.8/5. A total reach of 200,000 students. The online world of education, whilst not tearing up university leader boards completely, has certainly put all institutions on a more level playing field. By using marginal gains, all players have the chance to climb that medal table and end up as number 1.",,"INTED2017: 11TH INTERNATIONAL TECHNOLOGY, EDUCATION AND DEVELOPMENT CONFERENCE","11th International Conference on Technology, Education and Development (INTED)",IATED-INT ASSOC TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION & DEVELOPMENT,,,

We are currently at an early stage in the development of MOOCs; few studies have been published on their assessment so far. Consequently, this paper is based on a literature review, using the main academic databases JCR and Scopus, on 33 articles published between 2013 and 2015 with the objective of determining the educational quality of MOOCs. The methodology is based on a literature review procedure in which seven categories were distinguished when carrying out the analysis: course planning, contents, methodology, resources and activities, motivation, communication, and assessment and certification. The results of this study show that the assessment of the quality of MOOCs refers to a slightly higher than average quality, except for the three variables of content, resources and activities, and assessment. However, it warns of a lack of studies that assess the pedagogical quality of MOOCs and so we suggest further studies are needed with greater methodological rigour to obtain conclusive results.",,REVISTA ESPANOLA DE PEDAGOGIA,,UNIV INT RIOJA-UNIR,,,

They are offered from all types of institutions, especially universities, and they have many advantages for education such as ubiquity, gratuity, credibility and quality. However, research on their contributions to the actual knowledge of each individual are just beginning. MOOCs are still a big unknown for science, and it cannot be ensured that those who are certified truly possess the skills that are accredited through them. Also, note that its main virtue may become its biggest drawback. The overcrowding of virtual classrooms means that its contents are directed at the general public and targeted to a student of low and average skills. Its creators are completely unaware of the characteristics that participants have, and so cannot generate content based on their knowledge or experience. Its enormous scope and wide range of target makes adapting education to the needs of each student a complex task. However, from a theoretical review, this article discusses the potential that these courses really offer in order to personalize teaching and overcome the burdens imposed by virtuality in distance education. It also provides some keys to adapt MOOCs without forgetting to meet the ever-present diversity among its students. In general considerations, some methodological and sequential contributions can be highlighted for the implantation of a MOOC from an inclusive education perspective.",,EDUCACION XX1,,UNIV NACIONAL EDUCACION DISTANCIA,,,

The emotional orientations are typically related with specific learning topics or aspects discussed, which is of value to offer abundant academic feedbacks for teachers and developers. Especially, the negative emotion and topics can be exploited to get an in-depth insight of the problems and barriers encountered by learners in online learning. However, it is challenging to capture relevant details from unstructured SGCs. In this paper, we propose a generative probabilistic model that extends Sentence-LDA (SLDA), namely Emotion Topic Joint Probabilistic Model (ETJM), to explore negative opinions in terms of pairs of <emotion, topic> which we call emo-topic. The model first automatically extracts the sentences with the high negative emotion density (NED), and then incorporates emotion and topic together to explore negative emotional feedbacks towards topics. The experimental results show that learners extended some negative comments towards the issues about learning content, online assignments and certificates of courses. The summarization of these issues can be given back to teachers to regulate and improve the teaching methods, strategies and design of learning contents.",,2017 6TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF EDUCATIONAL INNOVATION THROUGH TECHNOLOGY (EITT),6th International Conference of Educational Innovation through Technology (EITT),IEEE,,,

A typical MOOC course consists of video content, self tests after a video and homework, which is normally in multiple choice format. After solving this homeworks for every week of a MOOC, the final exam certificate can be issued when the student has reached a sufficient score. There are also some attempts to include practical tasks, such as programming, in MOOCs for grading. Nevertheless, until now there is no known possibility to teach embedded system programming in a MOOC course where the programming can be done in a remote lab and where grading of the tasks is additionally possible. This embedded programming includes communication over GPIO pins to control LEDs and measure sensor values. We started a MOOC course called Embedded Smart Home as a pilot to prove the concept to teach real hardware programming in a MOOC environment under real life MOOC conditions with over 6000 students. Furthermore, also students with real hardware have the possibility to program on their own real hardware and grade their results in the MOOC course. Finally, we evaluate our approach and analyze the student acceptance of this approach to offer a course on embedded programming.

However, there exist high dropout rate and low passing rate of examination in many courses. So it is very important to predict learners' learning effect exactly. For learners who predicted good learning effect, teachers can impose intervention to help these learners to stick to the end of courses, while for predicted bad learning effect, teachers can take measures to help these learners to study harder to improve their learning. In this paper, we first analyze learners' learning behavior data to explore the differences among learners with different categories, then a cascade prediction model is proposed to predict whether a learner can earn certificate in a course.

WebOfScience,Proceedings Paper,"Turrin, R",Personalization Challenges in e-Learning,2017,"Online learning is a hot trend in the education industry, as testified by the proliferation of e-learning platforms and MOOCs on a huge variety of topics, from science and technology to foreign language learning and musical instruments playing. In this talk we will present some of the common challenges in the e-learning industry that we are personally facing at Cloud Academy, an on-line continuous training platform for Cloud technologies. First, the nature of recommendation objects is quite diversified. Typically an e-learning platform comprises several content types, such as video lessons, reading material, quizzes, practical exercises (e.g., hands-on laboratories), etc. Also, they can be organized into composite objects, such as whole courses (groups of lessons) or exams (topic-specific quizzes and exercises). Signals are very heterogeneous, too. Users can trigger all sorts of events while interacting with the learning platform, such as time spent on a given lesson video, outcome of a quiz or a test after a specific number of attempts, natural language feedback, etc. Such variety can be an important and comprehensive source of information but it must be normalized and handled within an appropriate common framework. The objectives of recommendation in e-learning differ from the case of more well-established targets. Although enjoyment remains a driving force (e.g., proposing new interesting courses to an old user), the focus is on learning specific skills or topics for specific goals. In this scenario, recommendation seeks to suggest the new best lesson, exercise, or course to acquire the desired skill while keeping the user engaged, assembling a personalized study path in the process. The pace of the learning activity must be tailored on the user's needs and commitments, like deadlines (e.g., the user plans to get a certification by a certain date), specific goals (e.g., objectives of an employee might be defined by the user's manager) or learning prerequisites (e.g., a course can be consumed only after the student has acquired the needed knowledge, either via other more basic courses or preexisting skills). Consequently, recommendations must take into account the initial user skills and knowledge as well as her learning objectives (e.g., improving the skills of a non-beginner student requires recommending more advanced material). Transparency plays an important role in the e-learning domain as users are willing to continuously monitor and inspect their progress and understand which training resources better fit their learning goals. Finally, the online learning environment can be made even more complex by social features such as virtual classes of multiple users, a context that recommender systems both can exploit and need to take into account.",,PROCEEDINGS OF THE ELEVENTH ACM CONFERENCE ON RECOMMENDER SYSTEMS (RECSYS'17),11th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems (RecSys),ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,,,

Attitudinal learning outcomes were evaluated using an author-developed survey with questions on perceptions in the four areas of attitudinal learning: General Learning, Cognitive Learning, Affective Learning, and Behavioral Learning. The survey also examined learner goals for enrolling in the course and their perceptions of the instructional methods implemented in the course. Results showed that learners perceived positive learning outcomes across all four areas. Statistically significant differences were found in relation to perceptions of attitudinal learning based on their reason for enrolling in the MOOC and its relation to attitude formation. There were also significant differences in learners' reasons for enrollment based on whether they intended to change animal welfare related behaviors due to their MOOC experience. Learners overwhelming indicated that the instructor videos were the most impactful instructional strategy regardless of whether they had a higher perception of learning, or a lower perception. Finally, learners with higher perceptions primarily enrolled in the MOOC in order to form a viewpoint on animal welfare, while lower perception learners enrolled to earn a formal certificate of completion. Implications are discussed for instructional design for attitude change as well as for the use of MOOCs for learning regarding social topics. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

However, little is known about which variables influence the intention of faculty members. Therefore, the purposes of this study are to empirically determine: 1) which of the characteristics of the educational innovation significantly influence the intention to adopt educational innovations, 2) which variables influence the readiness of faculty members intention to adopt educational innovations, and 3) how the characteristics of the innovations moderate the relationship between faculty readiness and intention to adopt the innovations. Participants of this study include 335 faculty members in ABET certified computer science and electrical engineering programs in the United States. The results show that ease of use is positively related to the intention of faculty members to adopt an educational innovation. We conclude that Open-Course Ware developers need to ensure that ease of use is emphasized in the Course Ware and they need to propagate these initially in institutions where faculty members have positive attitude to the Course Ware and care about student learning. In addition, a new method of identifying, building, and funding open access grant universities that develop easy-to-use educational innovations, make them available on an open access platform, and spread them widely by embedding agents in community colleges, schools, and other educational institutions is essential. Such an initiative may lead to wider adoption of MOOCS and other open access materials.",,KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT & E-LEARNING-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL,,LABORATORY KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT & E-LEARNING UNIV,,,
WebOfScience,Proceedings Paper,"Avery, TL",DISCUSSING DISCUSSIONS: ONLINE INSTRUCTOR BEST PRACTICES,2016,"A structured literature review was conducted to examine the range of theoretically framed studies examining online learning discussions within higher education. Key words to guide the retrieval were: online learning AND engagement or participation AND higher education or college or university not MOOC or MOOCs AND teacher or instructor or professor. This preliminary study did not differentiate between course discipline but did focus on higher learning, specifically university or college level courses that were not technical, certificate, graduate or professional. The study used four consecutive years of peer-reviewed ERIC documents. Of the 132 documents retrieved in the initial broad search, only 55 fit the search parameters, and only four of these were literature review-based. The remaining studies were primarily empirical, often focusing on one factor of online teaching or learning. The scarcity of current information is significant. Also interesting was the underlying emphasis on the Community of Inquiry (COI) framework, based on Garrison's seminal work in 2000 which highlighted the importance of engagement and community in knowledge acquisition. COI or constructivism is directly referenced in 19 of the 55 works and 31 of the 55 works employed key terms of COI theory. From a review of these papers, it appears that instructor decisions about how to structure a course, what to include, and how and when to become involved are ad hoc: the end result is that instructors' involvement in courses is variable and not guided by clear pedagogical principles. While the COI framework provides a good working model and a wide range of part of partial solutions and suggestions, there still remains a need for a more definitive guide. This study organizes relevant findings in the area of technical and learner considerations, as well as within the teaching, social and cognitive presence of the instructor, taken from the COI framework. Information, presented in a cohesive, comprehensive document within a valid pedagogical framework can better inform busy educators who desire to transform their own teaching based on relevant research. Future study could expand and critique this model, more fully integrating other models and looking at course-related variables more closely. Qualitative, quantitative and longitudinal studies can be designed which not only develop and expand the methodology suggested as currently viable within a learning community, but which also build on the potential for online learning to go beyond reproducing traditional courses online.",,EDULEARN16: 8TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON EDUCATION AND NEW LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES,8th International Conference on Education and New Learning Technologies (EDULEARN),IATED-INT ASSOC TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION & DEVELOPMENT,,,

The most MOOC platforms usually have rigid structures, limiting the content contributions to teachers' role and leaving students' contributions to internal forums, blogs or wikis only accessible for registered users. This lack of openness forces to seek external solutions outside the platform as learning communities such as social networks. Another problem is the difficulty of assessing the skills learned associated with educational evidence provided by the students, whether in external communities, without any possibility of evaluating automatic; or in discussion forums of MOOC platforms where karma or experience points will be awarded without any reward or certificate; or peer-to-peer assessment solutions private and with few social interaction.

Updating information in fields like general culture, information technology, language education and vocational education is needed. Online learning settings, certificate trainings, in service trainings and social network settings greatly contribute to updating information.

Lifelong learning can be defined as individual's whole collaboration of events which aims to develop their knowledge, skills and talents individually, vocationally or socially in order to manage their lives. It can be said that a web based learning settings has contributed to the learning processes the most these days. In this regard, people and especially universities grants free access to supply of information they have through Mass Open Online Courses (MOOC). In order for users to access MOOC, having an internet browser is enough. MOOC is also able to develop lifelong learning skills and brings the participants ways of self-learning and information gathering. Strong hardware and software substructure is needed for an MOOC system which will be accessed by thousands. Rapid developments in information technology have decreased hardware costs significantly. By decreasing the costs, developed software and hardware platforms are formed and brought into mutual use of people.

While most of the edtech community continues to focus on the major MOOC platforms (e.g.: Coursera and EdX), each of the major LMS makers now has a solution for teaching MOOCs as well. For example, Blackboard's Course Sites has offered open enrolment courses since April 2012, the very month Coursera was founded, although the organization's official press didn't mention the acronym MOOC until early/mid 2013. Moodle held a MOOC on their LMS MOOC platform called Learn Moodle on September 2013. LMS-based MOOC platforms offer a unique opportunity for instructors. Rather than having to rebuild course content within the walls of Coursera or EdX or entering into new, complex legal agreements, these platforms jump start the course delivery experience and can even use the native export/import tools of institutional LMSs to bring existing course content into a familiar LMS product. Similarly, taking a MOOC on an LMS MOOC platform can give instructors another unique experience - that of using a traditional LMS as a student.

The literature study highlighted the rapid growth in interest in understanding MOOCs and seeking to understand the pedagogic frameworks most relevant to their adoption and the importance of the concept of openness embodied within them. More recently a new emphasis has been emerging where institutional factors, particularly those concerned with financial viability, certification and retention have been highlighted. The analysis of current practice showed that many of the concerns in the academic literature were absent from not only the practices embodied in current MOOC-based learning experiences but seem to have been ignored in the conceptual phase of implementing a MOOC-based teaching model. In practice therefore, most of the current MOOC offer is only a pale reflection of the conceptualization that gave them rise and has been shown to be significant in the literature. In particular the true essence encapsulated in the concept described as Openness has been largely lost in practice.",,COMUNICAR,,GRUPO COMUNICAR,,,

These features, together with the quality of the training process, must be the main challenges for the coming years. These types of courses can have a formative role in higher education, not only in countries where MOOCs are already offered but also in less economically developed countries. To make this possible MOOCs must adopt different teaching strategies to promote personalized learning and offer some form of accreditation and certification. The future of MOOCs can be understood if we approach it from five dimensions: the teaching model, monetization, certification, adaptive learning and MOOCs for developing countries.",,RUSC-UNIVERSITIES AND KNOWLEDGE SOCIETY JOURNAL,,UNIV OBERTA CATALUNYA,,,

While MOOCs may not have democratized education, they have made IHE offerings available to millions across the globe. IHEs have successfully attracted thousands of new consumers as a result of offering MOOCs, but it is unclear whether MOOC participants are subsequently inspired to enroll in fee-earning programs. The uptake for certified series of MOOCs or specializations has yielded some revenues for IHEs but cost savings are more elusive. MOOCs have catalyzed a great deal of innovation and experimentation with online and on-campus pedagogy, but it is not clear whether this has led to improved educational outcomes. They have also provided a rich substrate for research on teaching and learning.",,MOOCS IN HIGHER EDUCATION: INSTITUTIONAL GOALS AND PATHS FORWARD,,PALGRAVE,,,
WebOfScience,Article,"Law, P",Digital badging at The Open University: recognition for informal learning,2015,"Awarding badges to recognise achievement is not a new development. Digital badging now offers new ways to recognise learning and motivate learners, providing evidence of skills and achievements in a variety of formal and informal settings. Badged open courses (BOCs) were piloted in various forms by the Open University (OU) in 2013 to provide a digital acknowledgement for learners' participation in three entry-level, unsupported courses: Learning to Learn and Succeed with Maths Parts 1 and 2. The desire to build on the OU's badging pilots is informed by research into the motivations and demographic profiles of learners using the free educational resources which the OU makes available through its OpenLearn platform. This research activity was repeated in 2014 and found that an increasing proportion of informal learners is keen to have their informal learning achievements recognised. This paper outlines how the evaluation of the 2013 pilots has informed the development of a suite of free employability and skills BOCs in 2014 that are assessed through the deployment of Moodle quizzes. It also discusses how the motivational aspects of digital badging support the growth in free, micro-credentialised courses against a backdrop of MOOC providers issuing certification for fee. The BOC project, which aligns with the University's Journeys from Informal to Formal Learning strategy, will help to provide accessible routes into the University for students who might not otherwise have the opportunity to participate and supports the OU Charter to promote the educational well-being of the community.",,OPEN LEARNING,,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",,,

WebOfScience,Proceedings Paper,"Speight, S; Bowman, A",INNOVATION AT THE MARGINS: THE NOTTINGHAM OPEN ONLINE COURSE,2015,"In 2013, the University of Nottingham offered its first NOOC (Nottingham Open Online Course), called 'Perspectives on Sustainability'. Using pedagogies drawn from online learning and 'MOOCs', the NOOC aimed to provide an opportunity for our global community of students and staff to learn together around a strategic priority area for the institution. We chose a differentiated outcomes model in which anyone with a University of Nottingham computer username (students and staff of all categories from our campuses in the UK, China and Malaysia) could enrol for personal or professional development, could choose to complete activities towards a 'Certificate of Achievement' signed by the Vice Chancellor, or could meet the requirements for credits towards Nottingham's co-curricular skills and employability 'Advantage Award'. The NOOC generated positive feedback and healthy numbers. From October 2014 it is available for degree-credit as a first year undergraduate elective. This marks a significant move from the co-curriculum to the formal academic curriculum and reflects a growing interest in educational innovations or 'positive disruptions' supporting cross-campus intercultural learning Following the first run of the NOOC (March-June 2013), we carried out a series of qualitative studies exploring student responses to learning online and to interdisciplinary learning for sustainability. In this paper we report some of our findings around student presentation of self, student-staff interaction, and cognitive engagement. We consider the opportunities and barriers suggested by this research and recap on some of the changes already made in response to subsequent versions of the course.",,"INTED2015: 9TH INTERNATIONAL TECHNOLOGY, EDUCATION AND DEVELOPMENT CONFERENCE","9th International Technology, Education and Development Conference (INTED)",IATED-INT ASSOC TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION & DEVELOPMENT,,,

WebOfScience,Proceedings Paper,"Kazmer, DO; Tucker, BG; Hajduk, EL",A model for realizing human potential,2014,"The realization of human potential requires each individual to consider their future possibilities relative to their current capabilities so that they may develop and execute a plan to gain knowledge, experience, and opportunities. Accordingly, a model is herein presented in which an individual's understanding of their own capabilities is informed by objective assessment after which that individual's perception of future possibilities is supported with a probabilistic career tree diagram. The proposed model provides a detailed registry of the individual's skills with indicia of scarcity relative to the needs of varying employment opportunities. In addition, the proposed model provides a roadmap for gaining knowledge and experience to advance and/or change careers. The proposed model provides not only a personalized and dynamic program of education, assessment, and certifications but also access to potential employers for the gainful application of human resources through an auction system to garner and allocate resources. While an example is provided for an Associate's of Science in Engineering degree using a variety of resources including Massively Open On-line Courses (MOOCs), the model is extensible to a diversity of professions and educational resources such as traditional college courses, industry seminars, and other hybrid programs that provide knowledge and abilities sought by employers. Each individual's potential can thus be realized by helping each individual to rationally choose their own career plan as a function of requisite costs, benefits, and interests. The proposed model is feasible from a technological perspective, and could significantly increase the rate of return on education across a lifelong career. While the proposed model could significantly lessen income disparity, it would not eliminate income inequality or the need for continuing social entitlements. Given current educational trends and societal pressures, policies related to program accreditation and professional licensure should be adapted to emphasize licensing of individuals rather than accreditation of programs.",,2014 ASEE ANNUAL CONFERENCE,ASEE Annual Conference,AMER SOC ENGINEERING EDUCATION,,,

These seven partners are KU Leuven (the lead partner), Rijksuniversiteit Groningen, Aarhus University, Tartu University, Lisbon University, Universidad de Granada, University of Bologna. Each of the partner institutions provides a module to the course, which is followed jointly by students officially enrolled at the respective institutions, collaborating over the web. LACE involves also physical mobility by teachers and students. LACE participates in the project OpenCourseWare in the European Higher Education Context: how to make use of its full potential for virtual mobility and originally planned to offer the course in a standard OCW format. We went however one step further and offered it as a - truly open - MOOC with OCW content under a CC-BY-SA license. The stated goals for the university partnership that offers this MOOC were internationalisation at home: attracting new groups of students to the course from different international backgrounds, more intensive peer activities such as richer forum discussions, enhanced exposure of the participating institutions to students outside of the LACE framework, and attracting possible PhD students. The MOOC was squarely targeted at the MA level (corresponding to 6 ECTS), required good knowledge of both English, European Culture and at least one other European Language and a solid introduction into literary theory. In october 2013 LACE was launched for the first time as a MOOC on the Canvas. net platform, where it was followed both by the regular, registered students at the participating universities as well as MOOC subscribers. The course provides content using weblectures, articles, course texts and hyperlinks. Peer interaction is organised through assignments and forum discussions. Students who finished the course received a certificate of accomplishment. This pilot aimed to explore the interaction of MOOC subscribers and the regular university students, programmes and facilities. The paper documents the motivations, choices and experiences in setting up the pilot, and presents the results of both a survey at the beginning of the MOOC as well as usage data and student response after having taken the course.",,EDULEARN14: 6TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON EDUCATION AND NEW LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES,6th International Conference on Education and New Learning Technologies (EDULEARN),IATED-INT ASSOC TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION A& DEVELOPMENT,,,
WebOfScience,Proceedings Paper,"Arfaoui, J; Stapff, L; Buben, M",ENSURING DIGITAL INCLUSION: LINKED'S INNOVATIVE APPROACH TO E-LEARNING FOR DEVELOPMENT FINANCE PRACTITIONERS ACROSS THE WORLD,2013,"Universities and business schools across the world are addressing the topic of inclusion primarily via financial barriers. MOOCs, Coursera and other buzzwords are the hot topics of the day. Participants around the world certainly benefit from lowering financial hurdles. Yet, from our experience, the contribution of MOOCs to increasing skill levels in developing and emerging countries is severely constrained by technological boundaries. Many prospective students of E-Learning in Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Pacific Islands incur substantial challenges. In many countries, internet is only available from satellite connection, and it is expensive and slow. Fibre optic cables are not the norm in Central Africa or in the Pacific Islands. This implies that fancy web based trainings and sophisticated interactive modules will simply time out. Yet it is exactly those prospective students of E-Learning in emerging and developing countries who stand to benefit most -after all the quality of local universities and business schools offering professional trainings may not always be up to international standards. Access to international best practice E-Learning would be a superb way to let the participants catch up. To address this problem, Frankfurt School of Finance & Management (Frankfurt School) developed the highly innovative, technologically highly accessible LinkEd platform to provide affordable part-time training opportunities to international development finance practitioners, eager for education but often hampered by the limited access to it. But how is it possible to combine high quality online education with low technical and infrastructural requirements? The LinkEd strategy is to mix modern and traditional online learning approaches allowing participants with and without high speed internet to follow the courses. Provide education and training opportunities for developing and developed countries Provide highly specialized and relevant knowledge on development finance Offer affordable and flexible six-month courses Constant development and improvement of the e-learning tools Offer an international network of partner institutions hosting the final examination, giving the participants the possibility to receive a Frankfurt School Certification In 2010, the pilot of the first Certified Expert in Microfinance (CEMF) was launched in India and became international one year later. With its international setup, the CEMF course has been offered for the fifth time starting September 2013. In 2012, the Certified Expert in SME Finance started and in 2013 the Certified Expert in Risk Management was added to the portfolio. Since its beginning, the LinkEd portfolio has been expanding and until today (10/2013) the concept has attracted around 900 participants from more than 100 different countries. However that was not enough, in March 2014 the Frankfurt School will launch a new course on Climate and Renewable Energy Finance. Summarizing, what makes LinkEd successful? The fact that we offer an alternative and affordable way of education to participants from all over the world. The fact that we offer the flexibility to learn along side of a full time job. The fact that high qualified trainers and experts develop and support the courses. The key factor of the success is to link all of this into one concept: LinkEd",,"6TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF EDUCATION, RESEARCH AND INNOVATION (ICERI 2013)","6th International Conference on Education, Research and Innovation (ICERI)",IATED-INT ASSOC TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION & DEVELOPMENT,,,

The main objective of the Project IT SCHOOL is to popularize basic knowledge of computer technology, to encourage young people to study in the field of Information Technology and thus facilitate the study of the core courses. In the framework of Project twelve online courses were prepared and opened with particular care in preparing self-assessment tests, allowing students to check the level of understanding of the learning material after each course (http://www.it-szkola.edu.pl). The final test assesses student knowledge and its completion allows receiving a certificate. Courses were met with great interest of the students. Within 7 months, the number of visits reached 3 millions, 25.000 registered students from 400 schools received over 70.000 certificates. Courses also received positive feedback from secondary schools computer science teachers. Research done among techers indicated a significant increase in student interest in education of computer science. In the next academic year, the number of on-line courses offered in the framework of Project will be doubled and new interdisciplinary materials will be offered.

They perceive also to be controllers of their progresses with respect to calendars, fruition, assessment results. Students come into the MOOC environments to develop or enhance professional competences, to earn formative credits and to achieve certifications to get more employment opportunities, but the statistics underline high level of drop-out and few released useful credits and final certifications. These problems are mainly related to the difficulty to guarantee the teaching presence in courses with thousands of learners having different background and to the ineffective assessment methods for a meaningful learning process looking at the objectives and giving feedbacks for individual learning paths construction. The work, in particular, exploits the adaptation and personalization features of IWT platform in order to provide ARWE (Adaptive Remedial Work Environment) in order to fill the lack of a one-to-one tutoring mitigating the drop-out problem in MOOCs. The main original contribution of this work concerns the definition of an approach to automatically generate quizzes, exploiting a semantic-based method, in order to populate the e-Testing tool existing in ARWE, decreasing, de facto, the effort for instructors in the assessment authoring phase.",,2013 12TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY BASED HIGHER EDUCATION AND TRAINING (ITHET 2013),12th International Conference on Information Technology Based Higher Education and Training (ITHET),IEEE,,,
WebOfScience,Proceedings Paper,"O'Brien, K; Oliver, B; Connors, P",DEVELOPMENT AND EVIDENCING ACHIEVEMENT OF GRADUATE LEARNING OUTCOMES IN DEAKIN UNIVERSITY'S ENHANCED MOOC,2013,"There is now a plethora of Massive Open On-line courses (MOOCs) offered worldwide. Whilst many MOOCs focus on discipline-specific content, little attention has been paid to how MOOCs can explicitly help participants develop generic employability skills such as communication, digital literacy, global citizenship and the like. Similarly little attention been paid to explicitly assuring the quality of MOOCs with respect to alignment with regulatory body standards. Deakin University's first MOOC, DeakinPrimer, is an introduction to humanitarian responses to 21st century disasters. It has been designed to assist participants to explicitly evidence generic or employability skills, some of Deakin's eight Graduate Learning Outcomes (GLOs) including communication, digital literacy, critical thinking and global citizenship. Other key features of DeakinPrimer include opportunities for networking with fellow participants and experts within the humanitarian field, and the opportunity to apply for credit towards the Graduate Certificate in International Community Development (level 8 in the Australian Qualifications Framework [AQF]) and for those with a prior Bachelor degree, the Masters in Humanitarian Assistance or the Masters of International Community Development (level 9 in the AQF). DeakinPrimer is designed as a test bed for a learning innovation, particularly micro-credentialing GLOs using digital badges to enable self and peer endorsement of evidence of learning. Badging is integrated in two ways. Firstly, DeakinPrimer participants build portfolios of learning artefacts associated with learning activities, then assess their work against a set of holistic, generic learning outcomes standards rubrics. If they judge their evidence as meeting the required standard, they can claim a badge (self endorsement) associated with particular GLOs. Secondly, participants can request and provide peer feedback and endorsement (using peer badges). The integration of self and peer review in the assessment tasks helps participants develop important employability skills, the ability to critically self-reflect on their own work and critically analyse the work of others and provide evidence-based feedback. DeakinPrimer is scheduled to commence in July 2013. This paper explains the way in which the course curricula has been designed to use technologies to enable participants to curate evidence of learning, and self and peer endorse such learning against defined standards.",,EDULEARN13: 5TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON EDUCATION AND NEW LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES,5th International Conference on Education and New Learning Technologies (EDULEARN),IATED-INT ASSOC TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION A& DEVELOPMENT,,,
