Scopus,Conference Paper,"Cobos R., Olmos L.",A Learning Analytics Tool for Predictive Modeling of Dropout and Certificate Acquisition on MOOCs for Professional Learning,2019,"Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) appeared as a proper way to provide lifelong learning for potential learners of both professional and academic settings. Industry leaders can benefit from these courses because they foster the professional development of their employees in their industry. Despite these benefits, these online courses continue to register a high dropout rate and a vast number of their learners do not acquire the certificate provided at the completion of the course. This article proposes a predictive modeling tool with several Machine Learning algorithms (for generating Predictive Models) and feature engineering in MOOCs data integrated to contribute research to this specific issue. The proposed tool predicts two situations: which learners are likely to leave the course (dropout) and which learners are expected to pass the course (certificate acquisition). The tool was tested in fifteen deliveries of seven MOOCs. Initial results provide interesting information, for instance, that the accuracy of predicting certificate acquisition is higher than the precision of predicting dropout for all algorithms. © 2018 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85061832448&doi=10.1109%2fIEEM.2018.8607541&partnerID=40&md5=0201e782bee095112b5e261dd2cc257b,IEEE International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management,IEEE Computer Society,"2018 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management, IEEM 2018",

This paper aims to give tutors a clearer vision for an effective and personalized intervention as a solution to retain each type of learner at risk of dropping out. Design/methodology/approach This paper presents a methodology to provide predictions on learners' behaviors. This work, which uses a Stanford data set, was divided into several phases, namely, a data extraction, an exploratory study and then a multivariate analysis to reduce dimensionality and to extract the most relevant features. The second step was the comparison between five machine learning algorithms. Finally, the authors used the principle of association rules to extract similarities between the behaviors of learners who dropped out from the MOOC. Findings The results of this work have given that deep learning ensures the best predictions in terms of accuracy, which is an average of 95.8 per cent, and is comparable to other measures such as precision, AUC, Recall and F1 score. Originality/value Many research studies have tried to tackle the MOOC dropout problem by proposing different dropout predictive models. In the same context, comes the present proposal with which the authors have tried to predict not only learners at a risk of dropping out of the MOOCs but also those who will succeed or fail.",,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WEB INFORMATION SYSTEMS,,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,

Many researches took place to understand why and find out how to resolve that phenomenon. Though success in MOOC has been defined through registrant capacity to achieve and obtain a certification. But finally, many of these approaches do not consider individual aim and intention meanwhile they are central to distinguish real failure from voluntary interruption. This article presents a new approach and evaluation of success in MOOC using a typology of individuals uses of MOOC. Analyses are carried out on data collected from 5709 people enrolled in 12 MOOC on the FUN platform, interviewed again one year later (n=1778). Results shows that six different uses of MOOC exist for which certification or achievement are not necessarily relevant indicators of success. According to the type of uses, obtention of certification and achievement vary.

Even though they provide several benefits, there are still some criticisms of MOOCs. For instance, MOOCs' high dropout rates or predominantly elite participation are considered to be important problems. In order to develop solutions for these problems, a deeper understanding of MOOCs is required. Today, despite the availability of several research studies about MOOCs, there is a shortage of in-depth research on course characteristics, learner characteristics, and predictors of certification rates. This study examined MOOC and learner characteristics in detail and explored the predictors of course certification rates based on data from 122 Massachusetts Institute of Technology MOOCs (MITx) on edX platform as well as data about the 2.8 million participants registered in these MOOCs. The results indicated that as the number of courses offered and the number of learners enrolled increased in years, there was a decrease in the certification rates among enrolled learners. According to our results, the number of average chapters completed, total forum messages, and mean age predicted course certification rates positively. On the other hand, the total number of chapters in a course predicted the course certification rates negatively. Based on these results, shorter and more interactive MOOCs are recommended by considering the needs of the learners, course content design, and strategies encouraging the enrolled students to enter the courses. © 2020, Athabasca University.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85090973313&partnerID=40&md5=3c59b9fa9fd2069efee279fd1204fc4e,International Review of Research in Open and Distance Learning,Athabasca University,,

The optimal pricing strategy of massive open online courses,2018,"Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) are raising worldwide concerns now. The educational characteristic of MOOCs makes it different from the traditional information goods, and its pricing strategy therefore deserves high attention. By observing that major MOOC platforms started to move from the certificate business model to the subscription one, we focus on the business model selection problem faced by MOOC platforms. In this paper, we construct a game theoretical model with a MOOCs platform, an educational institution, and a group of learners. We study the profitability of three models: the certificate model, the subscription model, and the mixed model. We find that learners' bounded rationality is a key for MOOC platforms to introduce the subscription option to learners. Interestingly, while having some learners overestimating their ability benefits the institution and platform, it does not matter whether learners underestimate themselves or not. © PACIS 2018.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85080875404&partnerID=40&md5=da454fda0d9733d21d32ddd450528c6b,"Proceedings of the 22nd Pacific Asia Conference on Information Systems - Opportunities and Challenges for the Digitized Society: Are We Ready?, PACIS 2018",Association for Information Systems,"22nd Pacific Asia Conference on Information Systems - Opportunities and Challenges for the Digitized Society: Are We Ready?, PACIS 2018",

Motivation for participating in such courses can be very different. Results of previous studies indicate that motivation is associated with persistence in university programs and in online environments. Therefore, is important to understand for which purpose(s) learners use MOOCs and to compare determinants, including motivation, of completion and non-completion. Still, there is shortage of evidence about the motives that are associated with MOOC completion in the light of different motivational theories. The aim of this paper is to compare enrolment motivations of completers and non-completers in programming MOOC. Studying motivation in MOOC, we rely on the expectancy-value theory, because task value as a main component of this theory is especially relevant for research aiming to explain people’s voluntary engagement in learning and for understanding what causes a person to initially choose to take part in a MOOC we need to understand value and worth of this MOOC for the participant. Two research questions were posed: (1) What are the main motivating factors for completers and non-completers of a programming MOOC? (2) What are the differences in motivation factors between completers and non-completers? Validated FIEM (Factors Influencing Enrolment in MOOCs) scale was used collecting data from 1,302 participants. The data on completion or non-completion of the MOOC was taken from the learning environment. Evaluation of the participants has been analyzed using seven factors discovered in previous research. Using multivariate analyses of variance with the Bonferroni adjustment statistically significant differences were found in four factors: ‘interest and expectancies for course’, ‘personal suitability of distance learning’, ‘usefulness related to certification’, and ‘social influence’. All these factors were rated higher by completers than by non-completers. Recommendation could be made for taking account these motivational factors to decrease dropout in MOOCs. © The Authors, 2018.

However, for 'last moment students', speed in passing the modules is either related to greater motivation, although in this case it is not related to better grades. Furthermore, students who complete tasks during the weekend take less time to complete the modules and obtain a better grade. In addition, a learning strategy is promoted by reconsidering who is learning: players (those who complete the course and earning a certificate), auditors (those who have completed a thematic unit or the whole module, earning partial knowledge), and spectators (those enrolled until the end of the course, who intend earning experience in e-learning). © 2020 by the authors.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85087701288&doi=10.3390%2fSU12124878&partnerID=40&md5=7d4247f8e64a610a5f430a37c430d070,Sustainability (Switzerland),MDPI,,

However, there are still many unresolved questions relating to MOOCs and their effectiveness. One of the major recurring issues raised in both academic literature and the popular press is the consistently high dropout rate of MOOC learners. Although many thousands of participants enrol on these courses, the completion rate for most courses is below 13%. This paper investigates MOOC attrition from several different perspectives. Firstly, we review existing literature relating to MOOC dropout rates, bringing together existing findings on completion rates and analyses of several specific courses, which identify factors that correlate to likelihood of dropout. We provide a meta-analysis of the basic figures on overall dropout rates previously collected to identify relationships between course factors and dropout rates. In addition, the literature is reviewed from a qualitative perspective drawing together findings on the reasons for dropout and methods suggested for resolving or reducing the dropout rate. Secondly, using themes emerging from the initial investigation, we provide a preliminary analysis of data gathered from a Computing MOOC run by the University of Warwick, UK and presented using a Moodle platform. Different aspects of students' demographic data are examined to see if relationships to persistence exist. An important feature of this course is that it has been run in two different parallel modes (traditional MOOC mode with peer support, and supported mode with real time, tutored programming labs). This allows direct comparison between the dropout figures for the two different modes. Qualitative information from student evaluations is also considered. Finally, we discuss our findings relating MOOC dropout rates, considering what factors are within the control of a MOOC provider and suggesting the most promising avenues for improvement. Our results indicate that many participants who may be classed as dropouts (for example, because they do not complete the necessary components to gain a certificate) are still participating in the course in their own preferred way (either at a slower pace or with selective engagement). This suggests that the structure of a course may not be helpful to all participants and supporting different patterns of engagement and presentation of material may be beneficial.",,EDULEARN14: 6TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON EDUCATION AND NEW LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES,6th International Conference on Education and New Learning Technologies (EDULEARN),IATED-INT ASSOC TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION & DEVELOPMENT,

Although retention and completion rates for nonpaying users have not been promising, these statistics are much brighter for users who pay to receive a certificate upon completing the course. We investigate whether paying for the certificate option can increase engagement with course content. In particular, we consider two effects: (1) the certificate effect, which is the boost in motivation to stay engaged to receive the certificate; and (2) the sunk-cost effect, which arises solely because the user paid for the course. We use data from over 70 courses offered on the Coursera platform and study the engagement of individual participants at different milestones within each course. The panel nature of the data enables us to include controls for intrinsic differences between nonpaying and paying users in terms of their desire to stay engaged. We find evidence that the certificate and sunk-cost effects increase user engagement by approximately 8%–9% and 17%–20%, respectively. Whereas the sunk-cost effect is transient and lasts for only a few weeks after payment, the certificate effect lasts until the participant reaches the grade required to be eligible to receive the certificate. We discuss the implications of our findings for how platforms and content creators may design course milestones and schedule payment of course fees. Given that greater engagement tends to improve learning outcomes, our study serves as an important first step in understanding the role of prices and payment in enabling MOOCs to realize their full potential. © American Marketing Association 2021.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85116068116&doi=10.1177%2f00222437211016360&partnerID=40&md5=fe900fec07d2ecfc47db2e7a53d2897d,Journal of Marketing Research,SAGE Publications Ltd,,

However, when utilizing the knowledge from MOOCs, learners need to go through a number of hurdles—getting course completion certification (MS Global Learning Consortum: An example of LIP accessibility information, IMS Global Learning Consortium Inc., 2001, [10]) from various providers, get recognition of the knowledge level of a MOOC in the related domain, and make it searchable for various purposes. In this paper, we propose a MOOC course certifying agency framework, which merges learners’ profiles from various MOOC providers so consolidated profiles are available in one place. Standards such as IMS LIP and Dublin Core (Feigenbaum and Prud’Hommeaux in SPARQL by example: a tutorial, Cambridge Semantics, 2011, [5]) are adopted and expanded to describe relate MOOC course profiles, learner profiles, learning goals, and related skill sets. It enables matching of qualified learner profiles for a job position and/or to identify a set of related MOOC course profiles for some learning goal. The potential employers look for a matching skill set from converged learner profiles through the agency. Each skill for the position goes through a mapping procedure with a corresponding MOOC course profile. After mapping skills to corresponding MOOCs, the framework searches for the converged profiles. The result is the list of learners who match or almost match a given job description. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85015729029&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-319-51472-7_13&partnerID=40&md5=9ed407cdbf5a9096f0a981f544ecaca8,Studies in Computational Intelligence,Springer Verlag,"4th International Conference on Applied Computing and Information Technology, ACIT 2016",

A number of MOOC learners engage in most or all course activities but fail to pass the course. To improve participation and thereby increase successful completion, this study explores the behavioural differences between certificate achievers and explorers that lead to their different learning outcomes. Eleven behaviours were extracted from more than 80,000 behaviour records for 215 certificate achievers and 456 explorers, which were categorized into four types of activities: graded assessment, content-related, course-related, and interactive activities. Random forest classifier, independent-sample t-testing, and lag sequential analysis were used. The results showed six important behaviours that are highly related to certificate achievement. Certificate achievers engaged in more course-related and graded assessment activities during the course, while explorers engaged in more content-related and interactive activities, and graded assessment activities occurring at the end of the course. Compared to explorers, certificate achievers exhibited more bidirectional behaviours in terms of interactive and course-related activities and more repeated behaviours in terms of course-related and graded assessment activities. The study has significant implications for MOOC learners and instructors in improving learning and teaching performance by implementing appropriate behavioural interventions. © 2021 National Institute of Education, Singapore.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099678976&doi=10.1080%2f02188791.2020.1868974&partnerID=40&md5=d9c5f1010b6bd9b0e2940b2a932729ac,Asia Pacific Journal of Education,Routledge,,
Scopus,Article,"Bonafini F.C., Chae C., Park E., Jablokow K.W.",How much does student engagement with videos and forums in a MOOC affect their achievement?,2017,"Engagement in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) is based on students who self-organize their participation according to their own goals and interests. Visual materials such as videos and discussion forums are basic ways of engaging students in MOOCs. Student achievement in MOOCs is typically measured using assessments distributed throughout the course. Although there is research on the basic forms of student’s engagement and assessment in MOOCs, little is known about their effect on students’ achievement in the form of students completing a MOOC. Using binomial logistic regression models, this paper addresses this gap in the literature by presenting the degree to which student engagement with videos and forum posts can predict students’ probability of achievement in a MOOC. It also explores the extent to which participation behaviors and their intention to receive the course certification can be used to predict achievement in MOOCs. Using qualitative content analysis, this paper discusses the quality of the forum posts exchanged by participants in this MOOC. The findings from quantitative analysis support MOOC’s pedagogical assumptions, showing that students’ engagement in forums and with videos increases the probability of course achievement. It also shows that intention to certify plays a moderator effect on the number of videos watched, enhancing achievement in MOOCs. The findings from qualitative analysis reveal that most students’ posts in forums display more information acquisition than critical thinking. Implications for practice suggest MOOC designers and MOOC instructors foster engagement in forums by implementing discussion prompts that foster interactions about deep meaning of concepts or application of concepts covered in the MOOC. In regard to videos, implications for practice suggest the creation of interactive videos that promote students’ engagement and control such as inserting guiding questions and segmenting the video content. Future research comprising multiple MOOC cohorts is suggested to validate the empirical model presented in this study. © 2017, The Online Learning Consortium.

We report on two case studies where cohorts of learners were offered coupons for free-certificates to explore price reductions might influence user behavior in MOOC-based online learning settings. In Case Study #1, we compare participation and certification rates between courses with and without coupons for free-certificates. In the courses with a free-certificate track, participants signed up for the verified certificate track at higher rates and completion rates among verified students were higher than in the paid-certificate track courses. In Case Study #2, we compare the behaviors of learners within the same courses based on whether they received access to a free-certificate track. Access to free-certificates was associated with somewhat lower certification rates, but overall certification rates remained high particularly among those who viewed the courses. These findings suggests that some other incentives, other than simply the sunk-cost of paying for a verified certificate-track, may motivate learners to complete MOOC courses. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Using dataset from xuetangX, one of the largest MOOCs from China, we analyze key factors that influence students' engagement in MOOCs and study to what extent we could infer a student's learning effectiveness. We observe significant behavioral heterogeneity in students' course selection as well as their learning patterns. For example, students who exert higher effort and ask more questions are not necessarily more likely to get certificates. Additionally, the probability that a student obtains the course certificate increases dramatically (3x higher) when she has one or more certificate friends. Moreover, we develop a unified model to predict students' learning effectiveness, by incorporating user demographics, forum activities, and learning behavior. We demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms (+2.03-9.03% by Fl-score) several alternative methods in predicting students' performance on assignments and course certificates.

In this paper, we present a grade predicting method that uses student activity features to predict whether a learner may get a certification if he/she takes a test.

The MC divides all learners into three groups including certification earning, video watching, and course sampling.

However, currently there is a very low level of course purchasing (less than 1% of the total number of enrolled students on a given online course opt to purchase its certificate). This can impact seriously the business model of MOOCs. Nevertheless, MOOC research on learners’ purchasing behaviour on MOOCs remains limited. Thus, the umbrella question that this work tackles is if learner’s data can predict their purchasing decision (certification). Our fine-grained analysis attempts to uncover the latent correlation between learner activities and their decision to purchase. We used a relatively large dataset of 5 courses of 23 runs obtained from the less studied MOOC platform of FutureLearn to: (1) statistically compare the activities of non-paying learners with course purchasers, (2) predict course certification using different classifiers, optimising for this naturally strongly imbalanced dataset. Our results show that learner activities are good predictors of course purchasibility; still, the main challenge was that of early prediction. Using only student number of step accesses, attempts, correct and wrong answers, our model achieve promising accuracies, ranging between 0.81 and 0.95 across the five courses. The outcomes of this study are expected to help design future courses and predict the profitability of future runs; it may also help determine what personalisation features could be provided to increase MOOC revenue. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85112268365&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-80421-3_20&partnerID=40&md5=ad80a7b375dd53bac187b1f6f2f5c1ca,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,"17th International Conference on Intelligent Tutoring Systems, ITS 2021",

Despite various features and benefits offered by MOOCs, however, unlike traditional classroom-style education, students enrolled in MOOCs often show a wide variety of motivations, and only quite a small percentage of them participate in the final examinations. To figure out the underlying reasons, in this paper, we make two key contributions. First, we find that being an examinee for a learner is almost a necessary condition of earning a certificate and hence investigation of the examinee rate prediction is of great importance. Second, after conducting extensive investigation of participants’ operation behaviours, we carefully select a set of features that are closely reflect participants’ learning behaviours. We apply existing commonly used classifiers over three online courses, generously provided by China University MOOC platform, to evaluate the effectiveness of the used features.

MOOCs demonstrate universities’ efforts in offering high-quality digital learning materials to everyone in the world, which should be encouraged. Nevertheless, as a MOOC platform must ensure its financial sustainability, it is questionable whether a platform’s profit-seeking pricing strategy will hurt the diversity of courses, such as eliminating courses with low certificate purchasing rates. To address this question, we adopt a game-theoretic framework to model the interaction and strategic choices of a MOOC platform, learners, and universities. Based on the certificate prices and revenue sharing ratios chosen by the platform for courses with various certificate purchasing rates, universities consider the competition intensity and decide their course quality levels, to attract learners. We conclude that all types of course will exists in equilibrium throughout the lifecycle of a MOOC platform, regardless of the technology maturity and competition intensity. We also find that course qualities may decrease when MOOCs become more accessible to learners.

This paper adapts the topic modeling approach of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to uncover behavioral structure from student logs in a MITx Massive Open Online Course, 8.02x: Electricity and Magnetism. LDA is typically found in the field of natural language processing, where it identifies the latent topic structure within a collection of documents. However, this framework can be adapted for analysis of user-behavioral patterns by considering user interactions with courseware as a ``bag of interactions'' equivalent to the ``bag of words'' model found in topic modeling. By employing this representation, LDA forms probabilistic use cases that clusters students based on their behavior. Through the probability distributions associated with each use case, this approach provides an interpretable representation of user access patterns, while reducing the dimensionality of the data and improving accuracy. Using only the first week of logs, we can predict whether or not a student will earn a certificate with 0.81 ± 0.01 cross-validation accuracy.

This work reviews four types of innovations in open publishing in terms of quality control, namely ""light touch"" peer review, post-publication assessment, social peer review, and open peer review. Synthesising the principles and strategies of these innovations, it discusses how they might be inspiring for developing solutions and models for MOOC assessment and credentialing.

Valuing aggregation and pricing disaggregation in higher education markets,2015,"Massive open online courses (MOOCs) have received considerable publicity over the last few years. Since they offer costless learning experiences, many have seen them as a way of reducing the costs of higher education. A commonly suggested approach is that learners should be able to take a range of MOOCsand use their certificates of completion to assemble a portfolio that reflects their learning accomplishments, with separate educational market-providers offering services such as advisement, assessment, and accreditation of the portfolio content. It is speculated that this fracturing, or disaggregation, of the current higher educating system would allow learners greater choice and reduce the costs of obtaining accredited degrees. This chapter explores the opportunities and challenges presented by MOOCs and the economic and educational implications of a proposed disaggregation of the higher education system. The analysis suggests that disaggregation would not necessarily reduced costs, but that it would inevitably destroy much of the unpaid-for-value that resides for graduates in the current aggregated system of higher education. ©2015, IGI Global.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84954578785&doi=10.4018%2f978-1-4666-8279-5.ch002&partnerID=40&md5=f7f5c9b56baf3d9b31191a7b163494ca,Furthering Higher Education Possibilities through Massive Open Online Courses,IGI Global,,

Despite these factors, the flexible learning offered by a MOOC has the potential to provide an accessible educational environment for a broad spectrum of participants. In this regard, the Wicking Dementia Research and Education Centre has developed a MOOC on dementia that is evidence-based and intended to address this emerging major global public health issue by providing educational resources to a broad range of caregivers, people with dementia, and health care professionals. Methods: The Understanding Dementia MOOC was designed specifically to appeal to, and support, adult learners with a limited educational background. The nine-week course was presented in three units. Participants passed a quiz at the end of each unit to continue through the course. A series of discussion boards facilitated peer-to-peer interactions. A separate ""Ask an Expert"" discussion board also was established for each unit where participants posted questions and faculty with expertise in the area responded. Results: Almost 10,000 people from 65 countries registered; 4,409 registrants engaged in the discussion boards, and 3,624 (38%) completed the course. Participants' level of education ranged from postgraduate study to a primary (elementary) school education. Participants without a university education (vocational certificate and below) were as likely as those with a university education to complete the course (_2=2.35, df=6, p=0.88) and to engage in the online discussions (F[6, 3799]=0.85, p=0.54). Further, participants who completed the MOOC engaged in significantly more discussion board posts than participants who did not complete the course (t=39.60, df=4407, p &lt;0.001). Conclusions: The high completion rate and level of engagement of participants across a broad spectrum of levels of education suggest that MOOCs can be successfully developed and delivered to students from diverse educational backgrounds. The high participation rate also highlights the combination of MOOC design as well as the scale of unmet need for quality dementia education. © 2015 Goldberg et al.; licensee BioMed Central.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84926341628&doi=10.1186%2fs12909-015-0344-z&partnerID=40&md5=47f30b3a9af951447852eab10d5256e1,BMC Medical Education,BioMed Central Ltd.,,

Scopus,Conference Paper,"Samuelsen J., Khalil M.",Study Effort and Student Success: A MOOC Case Study,2020,"Learning was once defined as the function of efforts spent in relation to efforts needed [3]. Provided that effort is closely linked to time, previous research has found a positive relationship between student effort over time and student success, both in university education and Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). With the complex environment of tracing and identifying relevant data of student learning processes in MOOCs, this study employs learning analytics to examine this relationship for MITx 6.00x, an introductory programming and computer science MOOC hosted on the edX MOOC platform. A population sample from the MOOC (N = 32,621) was examined using logistic regression, controlling for variables that may also influence the outcome. Conversely, the outcome of this research study suggests that there is a curvilinear relationship between effort over time and student success, meaning those who exert effort for the longest amount of time in the MOOC actually have a lower probability of obtaining a certificate than others who exert effort over somewhat less time. Finally, research implications are discussed. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85064672144&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-11932-4_22&partnerID=40&md5=34bc524a8e85e5ab5280a5177e8b1e5c,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,Springer Verlag,"21st International Conference on Interactive Collaborative Learning, ICL 2018",

We report on two case studies where cohorts of learners were offered coupons for free certificates to explore how price reductions might influence behavior in MOOC-based online learning settings. In Case Study 1,we compare participation and certification rates between courses with and without free-certificate coupons. In the courses with a free-certificate track, participants signed up for the verified-certificate track at higher rates, and completion rates among verified students were higher than in the paid-certificate track courses. In Case Study 2, we compare learner behavior within the same courses by whether they received access to a free-certificate track. Access to free certificates was associated with lower certification rates, but overall, certification rates remained high, particularly among those who viewed the courses.

The grades students receive on these tests and assignments determine whether they complete or become certified in course material. However, beyond receiving a certification, how do grades impact the learning behavior in students? Do students who receive poor grades actively change their overall activity to improve their grades? To better understand the impact of grades, we observe overall student activity on two MITx MOOCs for certified students and students who continuously participate in MOOC assignments. We use click stream data to compile the overall activity of a student and we use points earned divided by total possible points to calculate the students' grades. We observe that students with the highest levels of activity have some of the highest grades. We also observe that the difference in activity before and after the finalization of a grade (delta-Activity) have greater variation as grade increases. Finally, we observe very little changes in grades (delta-grade) for certified students when visualized against delta-Activity and that continuously participating students have greater grade changes compared to certified students. © 2019 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85078071780&doi=10.1109%2fLWMOOCS47620.2019.8939614&partnerID=40&md5=f03e98fae62fb837fb2f3f5be3da74f2,"Proceedings of 2019 IEEE Learning With MOOCS, LWMOOCS 2019",Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"2019 IEEE Learning With MOOCS, LWMOOCS 2019",

We often hear about the high dropout rates in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). On the other hand, there is a lot of movement towards micro-credentials, online master's degrees based on MOOCs, and formal MOOC degrees. However, what is the classic MOOC clientele actually doing with their certificates? What are the reasons why successful MOOC learners put a lot of time and effort in exams and exercises? Do employers accept these certificates in application portfolios? Do they allow their employees to participate in a MOOC during their working hours? Do they pay for the certificates? Are there any differences concerning gender because women are still in the minority in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) and their career paths often hit a plateau? These questions have been on our mind since we started offering courses on our MOOC platform in 2012. We have had anecdotal evidence, for example, that a participant was helped to get a new job with a certificate from one of our courses - yet this is ultimately just hearsay.

They offer low-cost education for both students and content providers; however, currently there is a very low level of course purchasing (less than 1% of the total number of enrolled students on a given online course opt to purchase its certificate). The most recent literature on MOOCs focuses on identifying factors that contribute to student success, completion level and engagement. One of the MOOC platforms’ ultimate targets is to become self-sustaining, enabling partners to create revenues and offset operating costs. Nevertheless, analysing learners’ purchasing behaviour on MOOCs remains limited. Thus, this study aims to predict students purchasing behaviour and therefore a MOOCs revenue, based on the rich array of activity clickstream and demographic data from learners. Specifically, we compare how several machine learning algorithms, namely RandomForest, GradientBoosting, AdaBoost and XGBoost can predict course purchasability using a large-scale data collection of 23 runs spread over 5 courses delivered by The University of Warwick between 2013 and 2017 via FutureLearn. We further identify the common representative predictive attributes that influence a learner’s certificate purchasing decisions. Our proposed model achieved promising accuracies, between 0.82 and 0.91, using only the time spent on each step. We further reached higher accuracy of 0.83 to 0.95, adding learner demographics (e.g. gender, age group, level of education, and country) which showed a considerable impact on the model’s performance. The outcomes of this study are expected to help design future courses and predict the profitability of future runs; it may also help determine what personalisation features could be provided to increase MOOC revenue. © 2021, The Author(s).",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85103185364&doi=10.1007%2fs40593-021-00246-2&partnerID=40&md5=ca8b0f62791896d2de0adc783021a552,International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education,Springer,,

These platforms also bring incredible diversity of learners in terms of their traits. A research area called Author Profiling (AP in general; here, Learner Profiling (LP)), is to identify such traits about learners, which is vital in MOOCs for, e.g., preventing plagiarism, or eligibility for course certification. Identifying a learner’s trait in a MOOC is notoriously hard to do from textual content alone. We argue that to predict a learner’s academic level, we need to also be using other features stemming from MOOC platforms, such as derived from learners’ actions on the platform.

Results of confirmatory factor analysis validated the 7-factor scale named factors influencing enrolment in MOOC (FIEM). FIEM comprises three factors of expectancies, three factors of values and one factor of social influence. The highest and lowest rated motivational factors influencing enrolment in programming MOOC are discussed in the paper. Interest in and expectations for the course, personal suitability of distance learning and suitability for family and work are the highest-rated motivational factors for those who enrol in MOOC.

We observe that the field of study and the characteristics of the institution providing the course play a role. We explain these results by the heterogeneity in preferences and peer recognition with regard to open practices.

We then examine two classes of features, social and behavioral, and apply a combination of modeling and feature-selection methods to identify the most relevant features to predict both dropout and certification. We examine the utility of three different model types and we consider the impact of different definitions of dropout on the predictors. Finally we assess the reliability of the models over time by evaluating whether or not models from week 1 can predict dropout in week 2, and so on.
